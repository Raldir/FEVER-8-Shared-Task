The war in Syria has put the issue of attribution in the spotlight, particularly in instances where CWC member-state Russia, which is Syria’s ally, has used its UN Security Council veto to thwart investigations.		

Has the OPCW taken any collective measures against the Syrian government for its confirmed use of sarin, despite allegations of non-compliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention?		
But despite confirmed use of sarin by the Syrian government by both the Joint Investigative Mechanism and the OPCW’s own fact-finding mission, the OPCW has not taken any collective measures.

The data also show that the Syrian government has been largely undeterred by the efforts of the United Nations Security Council, the international Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), and unilateral action by individual countries to enforce the prohibition on Syria’s use of chemical weapons.		

What is the expected publication date of the report by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) that may relate to allegations of non-compliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention?		
Observers anticipate that public and classified versions of a report by a new unit at the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) will be published on Wednesday, close to the anniversaries of a major chlorine attack on the then rebel-held Damascus suburb of Douma that killed at least 85 people in 2018 as well as a deadly sarin attack on Khan Sheikhun in 2017 which killed at least 89.

Has the United Nations (UN) confirmed the use of chemical weapons in Syria, and if so, who was responsible for these incidents?		
The United Nations (UN), on numerous occasions, has confirmed the use of chemical weapons in Syria.

Has the Syrian government complied with the Chemical Weapons Convention?		
On the contrary, Syria has repeatedly used chemical weapons in attacks on its own people.

The number of confirmed and probable COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. is estimated to be 377,883 in 2020. This total far exceeds 173,040, the total number of preventable injury death in 2019 (latest official count available).		

How many excess deaths are estimated to have occurred in the United States due to COVID-19, and what is the estimated number of lives that could have been saved if the country had acted more responsibly?		
The sheer magnitude of the COVID-19 crisis is hard to fathom. As of the published date of this report, the death toll from the COVID-19 pandemic has topped 215,000 in the United States, according to Johns Hopkins University.		

Would the US have had fewer COVID-19 deaths if it had handled the pandemic as effectively as other countries?		
Had we handled the coronavirus as effectively as any of these three countries, roughly 99% of the 117,858 U.S. Covid-19 deaths might have been averted.		

Would a timely and decisive response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the US have reduced the number of deaths attributed to the virus?		
More than 120,000 Americans have now perished from Covid-19, surpassing the total number of U.S. dead during World War I. Had American leaders taken the decisive, early measures that several other nations took when they had exactly the same information the U.S. did, at exactly the same time in their experience of the novel coronavirus, how many of these Covid-19 deaths could have been prevented?		

How many fewer deaths do experts estimate would have occurred if lockdowns and social distancing had started two weeks earlier?		
Our conclusions are strengthened by their consistency with the results from different methodologies. Two notable epidemiological projections, based on theoretical models of transmission and “idealized hypothetical assumptions,” have estimated that between 80% and 90% of American deaths could have been averted had lockdowns and social distancing begun two weeks earlier.		

How many people died from COVID-19 in 2020, and what is the estimated number of deaths that could have been prevented if responsible actions had been taken?		
During much of 2020 COVID deaths averaged more than 1,200 a day. Earlier in 2021, increasing vaccination rates helped to decrease the average number of deaths below 500 per day.		

How did the pace of COVID-19 deaths change over time, and what does this suggest about the effectiveness of the response to the pandemic?		
- Data from John Hopkins University shows the most recent 500,000 Coronavirus deaths occurred in the space of six weeks, at the start of the pandemic it took six months to reach the first 500,000 deaths.		

How many fewer deaths would have occurred if the US had acted responsibly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the estimates?		
- New data from Johns Hopkins University reveals that the global total of Covid-19 cases has surpassed 22.5 million, whilst deaths have increased to over 792,000.		

Would the US death toll from COVID-19 have been lower if the country had acted as responsibly as other nations with similar population sizes, urbanization rates, and pandemic timing?		
At least three factors enable meaningful comparisons of these nations with the United States. First, we scaled up their population sizes and Covid-19 deaths to match those of the U.S. Second, in each of these countries, roughly 80% or more of the population lives in urbanized, transmission-prone areas, similar to the U.S. Third, the pandemic took root earlier in these other countries than here, as measured by the date of the 15th confirmed case in each, meaning that foreign leaders had to act with less information to guide their decisions than did U.S. leaders.		

Would the US have had a lower death toll if it had taken earlier and decisive steps to combat the spread of COVID-19, similar to other countries that had similar information at the time?		
Yet other countries with the same information — or alleged misinformation — as the U.S. had at the time took earlier, decisive steps to quell the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.

In the days after Nov. 3, many states will continue to count ballots that arrive at elections offices if they are postmarked or sent in before Election Day, according to local laws.		

Can mail-in ballots be counted after November 3 in some states?		
While each state runs its own process, those mail ballots can take longer to count. In some states, the ballots can be accepted several days after Election Day, as long as they are postmarked before polls closed.		

Does President Trump's claim that the count of votes weeks after November 3 suggests a problem with the integrity of the vote?		
While President Trump has baselessly sown doubts about mail voting and warned of a national crisis should the result not be decided on election night, election experts say delays in no way suggest a problem with the integrity of the vote.		

Is the President claiming that there is widespread fraud in mail-in elections?		
""As far as the ballots are concerned, it's a disaster,"" Trump said before claiming that there is widespread fraud in mail-in elections — that's false.		

What are the potential issues with mail-in ballots that Trump lawyers may exploit to challenge the election results?		
Mail-in ballots will have plenty of flaws for the Trump lawyers to seize upon. Voting by mail is more complicated than voting in person, and technical errors are commonplace at each step.		

Do the president's claims of widespread voter fraud associated with mail-in ballots have any basis in fact, or are they an effort to undermine public trust in the election results?		
Experts say, however, that there is scant evidence of meaningful voter fraud associated with mail-in ballots, and critics have viewed the president’s attacks as an effort to sow distrust about the election results.		

Does the President believe that mail-in ballots are frequently falsified and that only Democratic-led states employ this voting method?

Is the claim that voter fraud via mail-in or absentee ballots is a widespread issue supported by the evidence, which suggests that while instances of fraud do occur, they are relatively rare?		
While the instances of voter fraud via mail-in or absentee ballots are more common than in-person voting fraud, the number of known cases is relatively rare.		

Is mail-in voting more susceptible to fraud than in-person voting, and if so, what measures can be taken to mitigate this risk?		
While always rare, voter fraud occurs more often with mail-in ballots. Richard L. Hasen, a professor of law and political science at the University of California, Irvine School of Law, says that election fraud occurs more frequently with postal voting than in-person voting, “but it is still rare.”		

Are the results of the 2020 U.S Presidential Election likely to be delayed due to the expected surge of mail-in ballots?		
What is more likely to be delayed is the result. State election officials in some key battleground states have warned that it might take days to count the votes given what they expect will be a surge of ballots sent by mail.

President Donald Trump is denying a report that he has suggested dropping nuclear bombs on hurricanes as a way of disrupting them before they make landfall in the United States.		

Did Donald Trump ever suggest using a nuclear bomb to manage hurricanes?		
During a segment on climate change in the first presidential debate, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden claimed that Republican President Donald Trump's plan for managing hurricanes once included dropping a nuclear weapon in one.		

Did Donald Trump originate the idea of detonating a nuclear bomb over a hurricane to counteract convection currents, or did this idea pre-date him?		
The big picture: Trump didn't invent this idea. The notion that detonating a nuclear bomb over the eye of a hurricane could be used to counteract convection currents dates to the Eisenhower era, when it was floated by a government scientist.		

Did Donald Trump ever propose a policy to detonate a nuclear bomb over the Atlantic to address hurricanes?		
- The sources said that Trump's ""bomb the hurricanes"" idea — which he floated early in the first year and a bit of his presidency before John Bolton took over as national security adviser — went nowhere and never entered a formal policy process.

Early messaging from health experts likely contributed to this misconception as health officials, including the U.S. Surgeon General, communicated that masks were not necessary for the general public’s protection.2 Guidance has since changed, as it is estimated that over 40% of people who have the virus are pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic spreaders and are likely unaware of their infectious potential.3, 4		

Did the U.S. Surgeon General and the Centers for Disease Control initially advise against the general public wearing face masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19?		
U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams had initially advised against the general public wearing face masks, saying they were ""not effective"" in preventing people from contracting COVID-19 and amplified the risk of health-care providers being unable to get them.		

Did the U.S. surgeon general and the Centers for Disease Control previously recommend against wearing face masks for the general public to prevent catching coronavirus?		
Editor's note: Health officials' views on wearing face masks have shifted as the outbreak spreads. On Friday, April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC now recommends Americans wear a ""basic cloth or fabric mask,"" not a medical-grade mask, in public.		

What do the U.S. surgeon general and the Centers for Disease Control say about the effectiveness of masks in preventing the general public from catching coronavirus?		
COVID-19 guidelines issued by WHO, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other agencies have been consistent about the need for physical distancing of 1–2 m but conflicting on the issue of respiratory protection with a face mask or a respirator.2 This discrepancy reflects uncertain evidence and no consensus about the transmission mode of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).		

Did the U.S. surgeon general and the Centers for Disease Control previously recommend against wearing masks for the general public to prevent the spread of coronavirus?		
Both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization now recommend cloth masks for the general public, but earlier in the pandemic, both organizations recommended just the opposite.		

Did the U.S. surgeon general and the Centers for Disease Control previously recommend against wearing face masks as a means of preventing the general public from catching coronavirus?		
SARS-CoV-2 spreads person-to-person through close contact and despite current guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control recommending face masks, only a third of Americans wear a mask outside.1 With concerningly low rates of the public embracing the recommendation to wear a face mask, patients around the country are showing up at healthcare facilities without masks and some are refusing to wear one.

12,New Zealand’s new Food Bill bans gardening,"Does the new Food Bill in New Zealand aim to ban gardening or is it focused on modernizing food safety legislation?		
“The new Food Bill is about modernising legislation that is now 30 years old. It is about ensuring that people who sell and prepare food do so safely.		

Is the Food Bill being misrepresented by the Green Party, according to Food Safety Minister Kate Wilkinson?		
Food Safety Minister Kate Wilkinson says she is concerned that the Green Party is endorsing misinformation about the impacts of a new Food Bill.		

Does the evidence suggest that the New Zealand Food Bill has any impact on gardening activities?		
Nevertheless, in light of the comprehensive regulatory scheme established for food labeling claims by the NLEA, the Commission is issuing this statement to clarify how its own authority relates to issues raised by FDA's food labeling regulations.		

What is the purpose of the FDA's regulations regarding food labeling, as stated in the evidence?		
In addition to requiring nutrition information on virtually all food products, the NLEA directed FDA to standardize and limit the terms permitted on labels, and allows only FDA-approved nutrient content claims and health claims to appear on food labels.7 While the NLEA is designed in part to prevent deceptive and misleading claims on labels, Congress also intended that nutrient content and health claims educate consumers in order to assist them in maintaining healthy dietary practices.8 The NLEA also mandated that FDA undertake a consumer education effort to educate consumers about the new food label and the importance of diet to health.9 Therefore, in keeping with its recently expanded and unique jurisdictional mandate, the requirements set forth in FDA's regulations have a broader purpose than preventing false and misleading claims in food labeling.		

Does the New Zealand Food Bill regulate food products or gardening activities?		
The FTC, FDA, and USDA share jurisdiction over claims made by manufacturers of food products pursuant to a regulatory scheme established by Congress through complementary statutes.		

Does the new Food Bill in New Zealand impose any restrictions on small-scale gardening activities such as sharing or trading produce with neighbors or selling directly to consumers?		
“Small growers who share or trade their produce with neighbours or who sell direct to consumers have nothing to fear from the new Food Bill.		

Does the new Food Bill in New Zealand require scientific consensus for food advertisers to make claims about their products?		
However, the Commission does not require food advertisers to establish that there is scientific consensus in support of their claims.		

Does the new Food Bill in New Zealand regulate health claims made about food products, requiring them to be adequately substantiated and presented in a truthful and non-misleading manner?		
The Commission shares the concerns underlying the NLEA, and embodied in FDA's regulations, that health claims be adequately substantiated and presented in a manner that is truthful and not misleading.		

What does the New Zealand Food Bill regulate, and does it ban gardening?		
The Commission's approach to the regulation of health claims in food advertising and FDA's approach to such claims in labeling therefore share many basic elements.		

Does the new Food Bill in New Zealand ban gardening or any other form of food production?		
Instead, this statement focuses on the general issues that are likely to remain relevant to the Commission's regulation of food advertising over time, as specific provisions in the FDA regulations are amended.

13,Wearing face masks will stop the spread of covid 19,"Does the evidence suggest that face masks are effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19 in both healthcare and community settings?		
A systematic review on the efficacy of face coverings against respiratory viruses analyzed 19 randomized trials and concluded that use of face masks and respirators appeared to be protective in both health care and community settings (8).		

Does the evidence support the claim that wearing face masks will stop the spread of COVID-19?		
Although no studies have examined SARS-CoV-2 transmission directly, data from previous epidemics (6,7) support the use of universal face coverings as a policy to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2, as does observational data for COVID-19 in an analysis of 194 countries that found a negative association between duration of a face mask or respirator policy and per-capita coronavirus-related mortality; in countries that did not recommend face masks and respirators, the per-capita coronavirus-related mortality increased each week by 54.3% after the index case, compared with 8.0% in those countries with masking policies (CT Leffler, Virginia Commonwealth University, unpublished data, 2020).§ Similar outcomes have been observed for other respiratory virus outbreaks, including the 2002–04 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) (6) and the 2007–08 influenza season (7).		

Does wearing surgical face masks reduce the risk of infection from Covid-19?		
Face masks (surgical type) reduced infection risk by 85%. Since face masks are comparatively cheap and easy to use, they are among the most simple and straight forward means to curb SARS-Cov-2 and Covid-19 transmission (see also [53]).		

Does the evidence suggest that wearing face masks is associated with a lower risk of contracting viral respiratory infections, including COVID-19?		
In observational studies, wearing masks is associated with a lower risk of contracting viral respiratory infections.3,4 For example, in a 2011 Cochrane systematic review published by Jefferson et al, the use of masks in case-control studies was associated with an important risk reduction (odds ratio = 0.32; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.39).3 However, the observational design is at high risk of confounding and mask use might simply be a surrogate measure for comparing more careful versus less careful people.		

Does the evidence from the systematic review and meta-analysis support the claim that wearing face masks will stop the spread of COVID-19?		
Efficacy of face mask in preventing respiratory virus transmission: A systematic review and meta-analysis.		

Can fabric masks, as recommended by the CDC, reduce the transmission of larger respiratory droplets and potentially slow the spread of COVID-19?		
The CDC failed to reference the National Academies of Sciences Rapid Expert Consultation on the Effectiveness of Fabric Masks for the COVID-19 Pandemic (NAS 2020), which concludes, “The evidence from…laboratory filtration studies suggests that such fabric masks may reduce the transmission of larger respiratory droplets.		

Can wearing face masks in public places help reduce the spread of COVID-19?		
Face masks are a simple way to help decrease coronavirus transmission and save lives. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, wearing a face mask in public places has been shown to reduce the spread of COVID-19, because those who are pre-symptomatic can spread the virus before showing symptoms.		

Can wearing cloth face coverings, including homemade masks made of the correct material, effectively reduce the spread of COVID-19 for both the wearer and those around them?		
Cloth face coverings, even homemade masks made of the correct material, are effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19 - for the wearer and those around them - according to a new study from Oxford’s Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science.		

Can the evidence provided support the claim that wearing face masks will stop the spread of COVID-19?		
Trials are under way to determine if masks can reduce the spread of COVID-19 (ClinicalTrials.gov: and NCT04296643); however, none were published at the time of writing.		

Does the evidence suggest that wearing face masks, including cloth ones, is effective in stopping the spread of COVID-19 in community settings?		
There is also little research on the efficacy of face masks, particularly cloth ones, in stopping the spread of COVID-19 in community settings, Julii Brainard, a senior research associate at Norwich Medical School in the UK, tells The Scientist in an email.

Our review of relevant studies indicates that cloth masks will be ineffective at preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, whether worn as source control or as PPE.		

Does the evidence suggest that cloth masks and face coverings are effective in preventing aerosol transmission of COVID-19?		
In summary, though we support mask wearing by the general public, we continue to conclude that cloth masks and face coverings are likely to have limited impact on lowering COVID-19 transmission, because they have minimal ability to prevent the emission of small particles, offer limited personal protection with respect to small particle inhalation, and should not be recommended as a replacement for physical distancing or reducing time in enclosed spaces with many potentially infectious people.		

Do surgical masks provide sufficient protection against aerosol transmission of COVID-19?		
While the data supporting the use of surgical masks as PPE in real-world settings are limited, the two meta-analyses and the most recent randomized controlled study51 combined with evidence of moderate filter efficiency and complete lack of facepiece fit lead us to conclude that surgical masks offer very low levels of protection for the wearer from aerosol inhalation.		

What is the evidence suggesting about the effectiveness of masks in preventing transmission of COVID-19?

Do the World Health Organization, Public Health England, and Swissnoso recommend the use of surgical masks to protect against aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2?		
The lack of understanding of the detailed mechanisms of transmission may explain the discrepancy of the recommendation to protect the HCWs with surgical masks versus respirators: on the one hand, World Health Organization, Public Health England, and Swissnoso recommend the use of surgical masks to protect against droplet transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and limit use of respirators for aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs)

The CDC, like many similar disease control agencies around the world, presents seasonal influenza morbidity and mortality not as raw counts but as calculated estimates based on submitted International Classification of Diseases codes.2 Between 2013-2014 and 2018-2019, the reported yearly estimated influenza deaths ranged from 23 000 to 61 000.3		

Did the number of flu deaths in the US in 2020 decrease significantly compared to 2019?		
Based on the figure of approximately 60 000 COVID-19 deaths in the US as of the end of April 2020, this ratio suggests only a 1.0-fold to 2.6-fold change from the CDC-estimated seasonal influenza deaths calculated during the previous 7 full seasons.3 From our analysis, we infer that either the CDC’s annual estimates substantially overstate the actual number of deaths caused by influenza or that the current number of COVID-19 counted deaths substantially understates the actual number of deaths caused by SARS-CoV-2, or both.		

What was the range of flu deaths during the peak week of the influenza seasons from 2013-2014 to 2019-2020, according to the CDC?		
By contrast, according to the CDC, counted deaths during the peak week of the influenza seasons from 2013-2014 to 2019-2020 ranged from 351 (2015-2016, week 11 of 2016) to 1626 (2017-2018, week 3 of 2018).6		

How did the number of flu deaths in the US change from 2019 to 2020, and what does this suggest about the impact of COVID-19 on flu-related mortality?		
The CDC also publishes provisional counts of COVID-19 deaths but acknowledges that its reporting lags behind other public data sources.7 For the week ending April 11, 2020, data indicate that the number of provisionally reported COVID-19 deaths was 14.4-fold greater than influenza deaths during the apparent peak week of the current season (week ending February 29, 2020), consistent with the ranges based on CDC statistics.6 As the CDC continues to revise its COVID-19 counts to account for delays in reporting, the ratio of counted COVID-19 deaths to influenza deaths is likely to increase.		

Did the number of flu deaths in 2020 decrease significantly compared to previous years, as suggested by the claim ""America went from 75,000 flu deaths last year in 2019 to almost 0 in 2020""?		
The mean number of counted deaths during the peak week of influenza seasons from 2013-2020 was 752.4 (95% CI, 558.8-946.1).7 These statistics on counted deaths suggest that the number of COVID-19 deaths for the week ending April 21 was 9.5-fold to 44.1-fold greater than the peak week of counted influenza deaths during the past 7 influenza seasons in the US, with a 20.5-fold mean increase (95% CI, 16.3-27.7).5,6		

What is the estimated range of flu-related deaths in the United States during a typical flu season?		
Since the 2010–11 season, CDC estimates that during each influenza season, influenza virus infection has caused 9.3 million–49 million symptomatic illnesses, 4.3 million–23 million medical visits, 140,000–960,000 hospitalizations, and 12,000–79,000 deaths.†††† Preliminary estimates for the 2018–19 season fall within these ranges.		

What is the estimated number of flu deaths in 2020 compared to the reported number of flu deaths in 2019?		
On average, the CDC estimates of deaths attributed to influenza were nearly 6 times greater than its reported counted numbers.		

How did the rates of hospitalization for flu patients change between the 2017-2018 and 2019-2020 flu seasons?		
Compared with the 2017–18 influenza season, rates of hospitalization this season were lower for adults, but were similar for children.		

What is the comparison between the number of flu deaths in 2019 and 2020 based on the evidence provided?		
Using data available from October 1, 2018, to May 4, 2019, CDC estimates that influenza virus infection has caused 37.4 million–42.9 million symptomatic illnesses; 17.3 million–20.1 million medical visits; 531,000–647,000 hospitalizations; and 36,400–61,200 deaths in the United States.

Is there a link between 5G technology and COVID-19?		
More research and experiments are needed. In any event, any health effects from 5G are NOT COVID-19. The key takeaway is that the new wireless technology is not connected to COVID-19.		

Is there a correlation between the presence of 5G technology and the spread of COVID-19?		
The theory attempting to link the pandemic to 5G is senseless. The coronavirus is caused by a contagious virus, and it’s spreading in areas of the world that don’t yet have 5G technology!”		

Is there any credible evidence linking 5G technology to the COVID-19 pandemic, or is the claim likely a result of a disinformation campaign?		
Misinformation about the health effects of 5G can be traced to a 2019 propaganda campaign promoted by Russian state television.		

Is COVID-19 present in areas where 5G networks are not available?		
FACT: COVID-19 is spreading in places around the world without 5G networks. For example, there are no 5G networks at all in Iran, yet Iran has been severely affected by COVID-19.		

What is the basis for the claim that 5G is harmful, according to the evidence?		
Over the last year, posts claiming 5G is harmful tended to be based on the belief that the signals are more powerful than those that preceded it (4G and 3G), and that therefore (the posters believed) 5G must be dangerous to life.		

Are there any correlations between the spread of COVID-19 and the presence of 5G technology?		
One of the first 5G and coronavirus claims we checked, that the disease had broken out in Wuhan because of 5G there, re-emerged with claims that Covid-19 hotspots were also covered by 5G, and that cases on cruise ships could be explained by the radiation emitting technology used on them.		

Is there any scientific evidence to support the claim that 5G networks cause the spread of COVID-19 or symptoms of the infection?		
FICTION: 5G networks cause the spread of COVID-19, or symptoms of the infection.		

How does the evidence support the claim that 5G causes COVID-19?		
While there are a number of different variations to this theory, most share a belief that, even if the coronavirus is real, it is largely harmless, and the illness and death which is occurring is in fact caused by 5G. Proponents of the theory argue that the radiation from electromagnetic frequencies (EMF) generated by 5G towers, which are more powerful than those used by 4G and Wi-Fi networks, absorb oxygen in the air and from living organisms.		

Does the World Health Organization (WHO) have any evidence that links 5G technology to COVID-19?		
WHO will review scientific evidence related to potential health risks from 5G exposure as the new technology is deployed, and as more public health-related data become available.

Masks have been used more than 100 years to minimize some bacterial or viral infections [24,25]. Also, it has been showed that dual respiratory virus or bacterial-viral infections can be reduced by the use of N95 respirators [26].		

Does wearing face masks increase the risk of staph infections by causing skin injuries or abrasions?		
Friedman agreed that masks do not cause staph infections, and are no more likely to lead to an injury or abrasion to the skin that could allow for infection.		

Are face masks a risk factor for contracting staphylococcus infections?		
Fact check: Staph infections are common and aren't caused by face masks		

What is one of the common bacteria isolated during secondary infections in COVID-19 patients?		
In COVID-19 patients, Staphylococcus aureus is one of the common bacteria isolated during secondary infections [21].		

Does the evidence provided support the claim that wearing face masks can cause infections from bacteria such as staphylococcus?		
However, masks have never been shown to be helpful in reducing SSIs [35, 37, 38].		

Does the widespread use of face masks in the community pose a risk of infection from bacteria such as staphylococcus?		
Since coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), using of face masks has become ubiquitous [5]. Using face masks by healthy population in the community to minimize risk of spread of respiratory viruses stays disputable.		

Is there any evidence to support the claim that wearing face masks can cause infections from bacteria such as staphylococcus?		
""In no cases have we seen or have we heard or have we had an association between mask use and staph infection,"" Makhzoumi said, noting that she has not seen an uptick of staph infections in her patients since the start of the pandemic.		

Can wearing face masks increase the risk of infection from staphylococcus bacteria if proper hygiene and sterile technique are not used?		
Staph (short for Staphylococcus) is a type of bacteria commonly found on the skin that is generally harmless, but can cause infection if sterile technique is not used when caring for your access.		

How can Staphylococcus bacteria be transmitted from person to person, and is wearing a face mask a potential means of transmission?		
For example, the Staphylococcus bacteria itself can be transmitted from person to person through direct skin-to-skin contact, including through contact with fluids or pus from an infected wound.

What is the context behind the tension between Black Lives Matter protesters and Blue Lives Matter/Back the Blue supporters, which may have contributed to the replacement of the American flag with an 'anti-Black Lives Matter' flag behind President Trump during a Waukesha campaign rally?		
There is an understandable level of tension between Black Lives Matter protesters and Blue Lives Matter/Back the Blue supporters as many of the protests were sparked by the death or injury of a Black person in a police-involved shooting.		

Is the flag that replaced the American flag behind President Trump during a Waukesha campaign rally an ""anti-Black Lives Matter"" flag?		
However, the slogan only became popularized after the Black Lives Matter movement gained traction, and it aims to draw attention away from the urgent problem of anti-Black police violence by equating it to the dangers police officers face on their jobs.

43,Donald Trump said that $15 an hour is too much for essential workers,"Does Donald Trump support a minimum wage increase to $15 an hour for essential workers, given his statement that $15 an hour is too much for essential workers?		
Even though the federal minimum wage has remained at $7.25 an hour since 2009, most Americans are now covered by higher minimums set by state and local laws – from Los Angeles to New York state to Washington, D.C. Organized labor and anti-poverty groups continue to push for $15 an hour as the new standard for all workers paid hourly, though given Republican control of Congress that prospect appears dim.		

Does Donald Trump support raising the federal minimum wage to $15 by 2024?		
This suggests the wage issue is still ripe for organizing, and public support will remain high. A current bill to raise the federal minimum to $15 by 2024 would benefit 41 million workers (Owens, 2017).		

What is the proposed timeline for increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, according to the evidence?		
Raising the federal minimum wage to $15 by 2024 would boost hourly pay for more 		

What is the current minimum wage and the established ""living wage"" according to the evidence, and how does the demand for $15 an hour compare to these wages?		
The demand for $15 seemed impossible, as it would mean more than doubling the minimum wage, and even far surpassing the established “living wage” (Rolf, 2016).		

What is Donald Trump's stance on the federal minimum wage for essential workers?		
Raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour for all workers, including tipped workers and workers with disabilities: I will fight to pass the Raise the Wage Act, which increases the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour for all workers - including tipped workers and workers with disabilities - and indexes the minimum wage to median wage growth.		

What is the hourly wage that Donald Trump considers too much for essential workers, and how does it compare to the federal poverty line for a worker with a family?		
The Fight for $15 has blurred the line between the “living wage” campaigns and the minimum wage. Now, the standard wage demand is for $15 per hour, which is higher than the federal poverty line for a worker with a family (about $11.70 per hour in 2016).		

Did Donald Trump commit to raising the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour if re-elected?		
President Donald Trump said during Thursday night’s presidential debate that he would “consider” raising the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour if he’s re-elected—a level that Democrat Joe Biden has committed to—but said he’d also strongly prefer to let states decide for themselves, in what was a rare moment where the candidates discussed increasing the minimum wage while the issue appears a top priority for many voters.		

Does Donald Trump's statement that $15 an hour is too much for essential workers align with the Congressional Budget Office's estimate that 27.3 million workers would likely see a wage boost if the minimum wage was raised to $15 in 2025?		
In analyzing the bill, the Congressional Budget Office said about 27.3 million workers would see a likely boost in wages if the minimum wage was raised to $15 in 2025.

Proponents of the Pox Parties believe that chickenpox is a harmless childhood disease and that catching chickenpox as a wild virus will provide better immunity later in life than the immunity achieved by receiving the vaccine.		

Is the claim that deliberately infecting children to COVID-19 at ""pox parties"" a good way to help create herd immunity against COVID-19 without a vaccine supported by the evidence provided?		
“Chickenpox parties” became popular in the 1970’s and 80’s as a way for parents to expose children to the virus at a young age, thereby avoiding any complications associated with contracting the disease later in life.		

Is the claim that deliberately infecting children to COVID-19 at “pox parties” could be a good way to help create herd immunity against COVID-19 without a vaccine supported by the evidence of parents intentionally exposing their children to chickenpox in the past?		
In the past, some parents participated in “chickenpox parties” to intentionally expose their unvaccinated children to a child with chickenpox in hopes that they would get the disease.		

Is the claim that deliberately infecting children to COVID-19 at ""pox parties"" could be a good way to help create herd immunity against COVID-19 supported by the evidence provided?		
Despite health experts saying the vaccine is highly effective and safe, some parents are still choosing to forgo this method and instead expose children to the chickenpox the old fashioned way — with an infection party.		

Does the evidence suggest that deliberately infecting children to COVID-19 at ""pox parties"" is a recommended method to achieve herd immunity against COVID-19?		
And although the vaccine exists, some parents believe the natural immunity children gain from getting the chickenpox is better than the shot.		

What are the potential risks associated with deliberately infecting children with COVID-19 at ""pox parties"" to create herd immunity?		
Aside from the potential severe complications of the chickenpox disease in party attendees, there are other risks to consider when deliberately exposing a child in this way:		

Does the evidence provided support the claim that deliberately infecting children to COVID-19 at “pox parties” could be a good way to help create herd immunity against COVID-19 without a vaccine?		
Although studies have shown that immunity through vaccination lasts at least 20 years, the long-term efficacy is still being monitored and assessed.		

Does the CDC recommend hosting or participating in ""pox parties"" to create herd immunity against COVID-19?		
CDC strongly recommends against hosting or participating in these events. Chickenpox can be serious and can lead to severe complications and death, even in healthy children.		

What are the potential risks associated with deliberately infecting certain individuals, such as immunocompromised persons or pregnant women, with COVID-19 at ""pox parties"" in order to create herd immunity?		
Persons without evidence of immunity who have contraindications to vaccination (e.g., immunocompromised persons, pregnant women) should be excluded from an outbreak setting through 21 days after rash onset of the last identified case-patient because of the risk of severe disease in these groups.		

What does the evidence suggest is a recommended approach to limit disease transmission and provide protection against subsequent exposures to a disease, and how does this relate to the claim about ""pox parties"" and herd immunity?		
[25]. Thus, to limit disease transmission during an outbreak and to provide protection against subsequent exposures, ACIP recommends that all persons without evidence of immunity to varicella be offered vaccine even if more than 5 days have passed since first exposure to the disease [9].

45,Cutting the umbilical cord straight away deliberately denies the baby natural immunity so that medical professionals have a reason to vaccinate and medicate them.,"Does the World Health Organization recommend cutting the umbilical cord immediately after birth, or does it suggest waiting for a certain period of time?		
Although there is much debate surrounding the optimal time to clamp the umbilical cord, WHO’s findings suggest that late cord clamping (one to three minutes after delivery or longer) is recommended for all births.		

Does the evidence suggest that cutting the umbilical cord straight away is no longer a recommended practice by medical professionals?		
However, those protocols have since been revised to recommend delayed umbilical cord clamping (1). Thus, analysis of the timing of umbilical cord clamping in relation to postpartum haemorrhage is considered important.		

What is the recommended timing for cutting the umbilical cord, according to the evidence provided?		
These findings also suggest that immediate cord clamping (ICC) isn’t recommended unless the newborn is asphyxiated and needs immediate resuscitation.		

Is delayed cord clamping only recommended for premature babies, and not for full-term births, in order to increase their blood volume?		
Delayed cord clamping is not standard medical practice in full-term births. The standard of care in obstetrics right now only calls for delayed cord clamping with premature babies who are more in need of the increase in blood volume compared to full-term babies.		

What is the recommended timing for cutting the umbilical cord and what are the potential benefits and risks associated with this practice?		
Immediate cord clamping is considered less risky than DCC because it allows for immediate neonatal care or intervention and reduces the risk of certain neonatal complications.		

What is the recommended waiting time for clamping and cutting the umbilical cord, and does this support the claim that cutting the cord straight away deliberately denies the baby natural immunity?		
Recommendations for when to clamp and cut the cord differ. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) advises waiting 30 to 60 seconds after the birth of a preterm infant, but acknowledges there is insufficient evidence to support delayed cord clamping in full-term infants born in areas that do not lack resources.		

Does delaying the clamping of the umbilical cord in healthy term infants have any impact on the need for vaccinations and medication in newborns?		
A more liberal approach to delaying clamping of the umbilical cord in healthy term infants appears to be warranted, particularly in light of growing evidence that delayed cord clamping increases early haemoglobin concentrations and iron stores in infants.		

Does delaying umbilical cord clamping by 30 to 60 seconds allow the baby to receive natural immunity that would otherwise be denied if the cord was cut immediately?		
Delaying umbilical cord clamping by 30 to 60 seconds is thought to allow sufficient time for blood from the umbilical cord to fill the blood vessels in the infant’s lungs, Dr. Raju explained in an earlier podcast.		

What is the World Health Organization's recommendation regarding the timing of umbilical cord clamping, and how does it relate to the claim that cutting the umbilical cord straight away deliberately denies the baby natural immunity?		
More mothers than ever before are inquiring about delayed cord clamping (DCC). This rise correlates with the World Health Organization’s recommendation that the umbilical cord should not be clamped earlier than necessary.		

Does delaying the clamping of the umbilical cord pose any risks that could potentially outweigh the benefits of allowing the baby to receive natural immunity?		
However, delayed cord clamping does come with some risks and there continues to be significant debate about the risks and benefits of waiting to clamp the umbilical cord.

What is the recommended length of time to wait before cutting the umbilical cord after birth, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)?		
Delayed cord clamping appears to be helpful for both full-term and preterm babies. For this reason, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends delayed cord clamping for at least 30 to 60 seconds after birth for most babies.		

What is the recommended time frame for clamping the umbilical cord after birth, according to the World Health Organization?		
Although there is much debate surrounding the optimal time to clamp the umbilical cord, WHO’s findings suggest that late cord clamping (one to three minutes after delivery or longer) is recommended for all births.		

What is the recommended timing for cord clamping according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)?		
The ACOG does not endorse the practice of delayed cord clamping but rather suggests cord clamping should take place between 30 to 60 seconds after birth, since the ideal timing for cord clamping has yet to be established.		

What is the recommended time frame for delayed umbilical cord clamping, and how does it affect the amount of blood transferred from the placenta to the baby?		
Delayed umbilical cord clamping is usually performed 25 seconds to 5 minutes after giving birth. DCC allows more blood to transfer from the placenta to the baby, sometimes increasing the child’s blood volume by up to a third.		

Does the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommend delaying umbilical cord clamping for full-term infants?		
ACOG guidelines only recommend delaying umbilical cord clamping for preterm deliveries, citing a lack of evidence to support the benefits of DCC in full-term infants.		

What is the recommended length of time for cutting the umbilical cord after birth, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)?		
Research suggests delayed cord clamping is safe and beneficial for you and your baby. Both the WHO and ACOG recommend delayed clamping.		

What is the standard medical practice regarding umbilical cord clamping in full-term births, according to the evidence provided?		
Delayed cord clamping is not standard medical practice in full-term births. The standard of care in obstetrics right now only calls for delayed cord clamping with premature babies who are more in need of the increase in blood volume compared to full-term babies.		

What are the potential risks associated with delaying the clamping of the umbilical cord, and how do they relate to the claim that the cord should not be cut until 1 hour after birth?

Does Joe Biden support an outright ban on fracking in the US?		
Biden does not support an outright fracking ban, even though he spoke inaccurately about his stance on the debate stage in March.		

Does Joe Biden's plan propose a complete ban on fracking in the US, or does it have more specific restrictions on new fracking on public lands and waters?		
Biden’s written plan, conversely, never included a full ban on fracking or even on new fracking. Rather, it proposes “banning new oil and gas permitting on public lands and waters” – not ending all new fracking anywhere or ending all existing fracking on public lands and waters.		

Does Joe Biden support a ban on fracking in the US?		
The claim that Joe Biden wants to eliminate fracking is false because it ignores his publicly stated opposition to such a ban.

Ferdinand Marcos always had the ambition to be the President of the Philippines. In his campaign for the 1949 elections, he declared that if he would be elected as congressman, he promise to have an Ilocano president in 20 years' time.[4] Marcos slowly ascended into power and then attempted to run as president in 1961, but he lost to Macapagal in the nominations.[5]

However, it doesn't account for unconfirmed COVID-19 cases or unattributed excess deaths, and therefore carries uncertainties that may not reflect the disease's actual death rate.		

Does the evidence suggest that the number of deaths from Covid-19 is increasing or decreasing over time?		
If cases and deaths are growing rapidly by the day, the pace of total infections and fatalities over time will have steep upward trajectories, while decreases in daily numbers leads to a flatter line.		

What is the percentage of confirmed cases that have resulted in a death attributed to COVID-19, according to the case fatality rate?		
The case fatality rate is another key COVID-19 metric. This measure reflects the percentage of confirmed cases that have resulted in a death attributed to the disease.		

Does the evidence suggest that the number of new cases of COVID-19 has decreased, which would support the claim that the curve has been flattened?

Trump Jr., and Ivanka Trump banned from ever operating a charity again due to allegations of stealing donations for children with cancer?		
The allegations involving members of the Trump family and a children's cancer charity are separate from the New York lawsuit against the Trump Foundation that sought to bar some of the family from running charities in that state.		

Did Eric Trump, Donald J. Trump Jr., and Ivanka Trump engage in ""extensive unlawful political conduct"" and use the Trump Foundation as their personal checkbook?		
On June 14, 2018, the new New York attorney general Barbara Underwood filed a civil suit against the foundation, Trump himself, and Trump's adult children—Ivanka, Eric and Donald Jr.—alleging they had engaged in ""extensive unlawful political conduct"" and that Donald Trump had been using the foundation ""as his personal checkbook"" to, among other things, settle his personal legal debts and support his presidential campaign.[141][42]		

Did the settlement of the lawsuit against the Trump Foundation include any penalties or restrictions on Eric Trump, Donald J. Trump Jr., and Ivanka Trump's ability to operate a charity in the future?		
The settlement also included an admission from Trump that he personally misused foundation funds and called for mandatory training requirements for the now-defunct foundation's directors — Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump and Eric Trump.

How did the Trump family members allegedly use the Eric Trump Foundation to divert donations intended for charity?		
Additionally, the Donald J. Trump Foundation, which has come under previous scrutiny for self-dealing and advancing the interests of its namesake rather than those of charity, apparently used the Eric Trump Foundation to funnel $100,000 in donations into revenue for the Trump Organization.		

Were Eric Trump, Donald J. Trump Jr., and Ivanka Trump banned from ever operating a charity again due to allegations of stealing donations for children with cancer?		
Eric Trump’s foundation has also come under scrutiny, but the lawsuit seeking to ban the Trumps’ involvement in New York charities is not tied to the Eric Trump Foundation.		

Did Eric Trump, Donald J. Trump Jr., and Ivanka Trump use the Donald J. Trump Foundation to serve their own business and political interests, rather than its intended purpose of supporting charitable causes?		
The attorney general in New York filed a lawsuit last year alleging Trump and his three eldest children - Don Jr, Ivanka and Eric - broke campaign finance laws in 2016 by using the Donald J Trump Foundation’s tax-exempt status “as little more than a checkbook to serve Mr Trump’s business and political interests”.		

What were the consequences for Eric Trump, Donald J. Trump Jr., and Ivanka Trump regarding their roles as officers and directors of charities?		
Another stipulation ensures that Donald Trump, Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump received training on the duties of officers and directors of charities so that they cannot allow the illegal activity they oversaw at the Trump Foundation to take place again.		

What happened to the Trump Foundation after 1999 and what was the fate of the donations made to it?

""The weight of evidence we examined from both historical and modern analyses of the 1918 influenza pandemic favors a scenario in which viral damage followed by bacterial pneumonia led to the vast majority of deaths,"" says co-author NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. ""		

What was the primary cause of most 1918-1919 Spanish flu deaths, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci's research?		
The majority of deaths during the influenza pandemic of 1918-1919 were not caused by the influenza virus acting alone, report researchers from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health.		

What was the primary cause of most 1918-1919 Spanish flu deaths, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci's 2008 paper?		
In the most recent influenza pandemic that did not involve the use of antibiotics to suppress bacteria (the 1918–1919 pandemic), histological and bacteriologic evidence suggests that the vast majority of influenza deaths resulted from secondary bacterial pneumonia.		

What was the primary cause of most 1918-1919 Spanish flu deaths, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci's 2008 paper?		
Conclusions: The majority of deaths in the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic likely resulted directly from secondary bacterial pneumonia caused by common upper respiratory-tract bacteria.		

Did Dr. Anthony Fauci's 2008 paper conclude that most 1918-1919 Spanish Influenza pandemic deaths were caused by bacterial pneumonia, and if so, what was the evidence presented in the paper to support this conclusion?		
The question of whether the pathogenesis of severe influenza-associated pneumonia was primarily viral (i.e., assumed to be an unknown etiologic agent in 1918) or a combination of viral and bacterial agents was carefully considered by pathologists in 1918–1919, without definitive resolution [26, 33].		

What was the primary cause of most 1918-1919 Spanish flu deaths, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci's 2008 paper?		
Based on contemporary and modern evidence, we conclude here that influenza A virus infection in conjunction with bacterial infection led to most of the deaths during the 1918–1919 pandemic.		

Did Dr. Anthony Fauci's 2008 paper conclude that most 1918-1919 Spanish Influenza pandemic deaths were caused by bacterial pneumonia, and if so, what was the specific factor contributing to this outcome?		
Historical autopsy reports and examination of lung tissue sections from 1918 to 19 influenza case material indicated that for a significant number of patients, the cause of death was not primary viral pneumonia (Brundage and Shanks, 2008; Morens et al., 2008; Chien et al., 2009).		

What was the primary cause of most 1918-1919 Spanish flu deaths, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci's 2008 paper?

Did Dr. Anthony Fauci's 2008 paper find a correlation between mask-wearing and bacterial pneumonia during the 1918-1919 Spanish Influenza pandemic?

Did Dr. Anthony Fauci's 2008 paper conclude that most 1918-1919 Spanish Influenza pandemic deaths were caused by bacterial pneumonia from wearing masks?		
Interestingly, a recent study in ferrets demonstrated that the 1918 influenza virus could spread to, and induce cytokine responses in tissues outside the respiratory tract, which likely contributed to the severity of the infection (de Wit et al., 2018) and could explain the neurological complications observed during the 1918 influenza pandemic (Alexander, 1919; Ravenholt and Foege, 1982).

“We agree completely that bacterial pneumonia played a major role in the mortality of the 1918 pandemic,” says Anthony Fauci, director of National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease in Bethesda, Maryland, and author of another journal article out next month that comes to a similar conclusion.		

What is Dr. Anthony Fauci's opinion on the cause of most deaths during the 1918-1919 Spanish Flu pandemic?		
Many influenza experts, policy makers, and knowledgeable observers believe that a novel influenza A (H1N1) strain directly caused most deaths during the 1918–19 pandemic, often from a hemorrhagic pneumonitis that rapidly progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death (1–3).		

What was the primary cause of most 1918-1919 Spanish flu deaths, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci's paper?

Did Dr. Anthony Fauci's paper conclude that the majority of deaths in the 1918-1919 Spanish Flu pandemic were caused by bacterial pneumonia from wearing masks?		
However, healthcare providers, medical experts, and published data from the 1918 period suggest that most deaths were caused by secondary bacterial pneumonias (5–12); hemorrhagic pneumonitis that rapidly progressed to death was considered an alarming but uncommon clinical manifestation (8,11–13).		

Did Dr. Anthony Fauci's paper on the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic suggest that bacterial pneumonia was the primary cause of death, rather than bacterial pneumonia caused by wearing masks?		
Medical and scientific experts now agree that bacteria, not influenza viruses, were the greatest cause of death during the 1918 flu pandemic.		

Did Dr. Anthony Fauci's 2008 paper suggest that bacterial pneumonia caused by common upper respiratory-tract bacteria was the primary cause of most 1918-1919 Spanish flu deaths?		
Morens et al (2008) found that during the Spanish flu “the majority of deaths … likely resulted directly from secondary bacterial pneumonia caused by common upper respiratory–tract bacteria.”19		

Did Dr. Anthony Fauci's paper on the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic suggest that bacterial pneumonia, rather than mask-wearing, was a major contributor to the high mortality rate among newly arrived soldiers?		
The role of secondary bacterial infections during the 1918 pandemic is consistent with epidemiological observations that while influenza virus attack rates in 1918 were similar among soldiers and civilians, mortality rates were much higher amongst newly arrived soldiers (Shanks et al., 2016b).		

Did Dr. Anthony Fauci's paper suggest that the majority of deaths in 1918-1919 were caused by bacterial pneumonia, and if so, what was the basis for this conclusion?		
We have identified epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of the 1918–19 pandemic that are not readily consistent with the view that most deaths were caused by the direct effects of an inherently hypervirulent virus and were clinically expressed as rapidly progressing, ultimately fatal pneumonitis.

72,The daughter of Muahammadu Buhari (the President of Nigeria) is a board member of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).,"How is the Nigerian President involved in the appointment of the board members of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC)?		
For instance, the Nigerian President appoints the Minister of Petroleum Resources, who is also the Chairperson of NNPC's board.		

Does the evidence provided suggest that the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) shares its accounts with the Nigeria government, including the names of the accounts, which could potentially reveal information about the board members, including the daughter of Muahammadu Buhari?		
Moreover, the record evidence belies NNPC's argument that it does not share the accounts with the Nigeria government—including the names of the accounts, which suggest they belong to or are maintained for NNPC.		

Did Muhammadu Buhari's daughter become a board member of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) after he became President of Nigeria?		
In December 2014, Muhammadu Buhari went on the record to say he would abolish the office of the First Lady if he was elected as president, claiming it was unconstitutional.[225][226]		

Is the evidence provided relevant to the claim that the daughter of Muahammadu Buhari is a board member of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC)?		
This argument is meritless. The NNPC employees cited do not make the judicial admission that NNPC is an alter ego of Nigeria—rather, they state that NNPC is generally an agent of Nigeria.		

Is the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) a board member of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation?		
Such a statement does not solve the legal question of whether NNPC is Nigeria's alter ego, especially given the fact that NNPC concedes it is an instrumentality of Nigeria.		

Can the President of Nigeria, as the head of the NNPC, make decisions without the approval of the board, given that his daughter is a board member of the corporation?		
For instance, the Nigerian President can make decisions for NNPC without board approval or that benefit Nigeria rather than NNPC.		

What position did Muhammadu Buhari hold at the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) in 1977?		
In 1977, when the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation was created, Buhari was appointed as its chairman, a position he held until 1978.[42]		

Is the daughter of Muhammadu Buhari a board member of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC)?		
By the latest November 2007, President Umaru Musa Yar'Adua of Nigeria established the Presidential Investment Committee (the ""Committee"") to determine whether NNPC should be taking—known as ""lifting""—more oil than Esso was allocating to NNPC under the Agreement.		

Is there any evidence that Muhammadu Buhari's daughter is a board member of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC)?		
In 2012, Buhari's name was included on a list published by Boko Haram of individuals it would trust to mediate between the group and the Federal Government.[221]		

Is the daughter of Muahammadu Buhari a board member of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC)?		
Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). This is potentially welcome, yet the bill fails

COVID-19 deaths included those in which COVID-19 was cited as an underlying or contributing cause. Data for deaths not attributed to COVID-19 were only available for underlying causes of death, including Alzheimer disease, heart disease, and 10 other grouped causes, defined elsewhere.1 Reopening dates were obtained from the New York Times.6		

How many excess deaths in the United States between 1 March and 1 August 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic were not directly attributed to the coronavirus?

How do the excess deaths attributed to non-infectious causes during the COVID-19 surges in the US between March and August 2020 relate to the claim that a third of excess deaths during this period could not be directly attributed to the coronavirus?		
US deaths attributed to some noninfectious causes increased during COVID-19 surges. Excess deaths attributed to causes other than COVID-19 could reflect deaths from unrecognized or undocumented infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or deaths among uninfected patients resulting from disruptions produced by the pandemic.		

In which states did more than 50% of excess deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic between 1 March and 1 August 2020 not directly attribute to the coronavirus?

What percentage of excess deaths in the United States between 1 March and 1 August 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic were directly attributed to the coronavirus?		
COVID-19 was a documented cause of only 67% of these excess deaths. Some states had greater difficulty than others in containing community spread, causing protracted elevations in excess deaths that extended into the summer.		

What proportion of excess deaths in the United States between 1 March and 1 August 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic were attributed to causes other than the coronavirus?

82,In the US lockdowns are partly responsible for excess deaths not directly attributed to COVID-19 which were observed in 2020.,"How do the increased deaths from circulatory diseases, Alzheimer disease and dementia, and respiratory diseases in 2020 compared to past years relate to the lockdowns and the excess deaths not directly attributed to COVID-19?		
Specifically, deaths from circulatory diseases, Alzheimer disease and dementia, and respiratory diseases have increased in 2020 relative to past years (7), and it is unclear to what extent these represent misclassified COVID-19 deaths or deaths indirectly related to the pandemic (e.g., because of disruptions in health care access or utilization).		

How do the estimates of excess deaths in the US in 2020, which include deaths not directly attributed to COVID-19, relate to the lockdowns implemented during the pandemic?		
Estimates of excess deaths can provide a comprehensive account of mortality related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including deaths that are directly or indirectly attributable to COVID-19.		

How do the estimates of excess deaths attributed to COVID-19 potentially underestimate the actual number of deaths directly attributable to the pandemic, and what role might lockdowns play in this underestimation?		
Finally, estimates of excess deaths attributed to COVID-19 might underestimate the actual number directly attributable to COVID-19, because deaths from other causes might represent misclassified COVID-19–related deaths or deaths indirectly caused by the pandemic.		

How do the observed large increases in mortality from heart disease, diabetes, and other diseases in 2020 contribute to the evidence that lockdowns in the US may be partly responsible for excess deaths not directly attributed to COVID-19?		
Large increases in mortality from heart disease, diabetes, and other diseases were observed. Further investigation is required to determine the extent to which these trends represent nonrespiratory manifestations of COVID-19 or secondary pandemic mortality caused by disruptions in society that diminished or delayed access to health care and the social determinants of health (eg, jobs, income, food security).		

How do the lockdowns and pandemic response measures contribute to the excess deaths not directly attributed to COVID-19 in the US in 2020, and what are the potential underlying causes of these excess deaths?		
The number of excess deaths reported herein could reflect increases in rates of death directly caused by the virus, increases indirectly related to the pandemic response (eg, due to avoidance of health care), as well as declines in certain causes (eg, deaths due to motor vehicle collisions or triggered by air pollution).		

Does the study suggest that the lockdowns in the US contributed to excess deaths from underlying causes such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease, in addition to COVID-19?		
In a recent study, states with large numbers of COVID-19–associated deaths also experienced large proportional increases in deaths from other underlying causes, including diabetes and cardiovascular disease (7).		

In which 14 states did more than 50% of excess deaths in 2020 not directly attributed to COVID-19 occur, and what were the specific percentages of excess deaths attributed to underlying causes other than COVID-19 in these states?		
In 14 states, more than 50% of excess deaths were attributed to underlying causes other than COVID-19; these included California (55% of excess deaths) and Texas (64% of excess deaths) (Table).		

What proportion of excess deaths in the US during 2020 were attributed to causes other than COVID-19?		
Two thirds of excess deaths during the analysis period (66.2%; 198,081) were attributed to COVID-19 and the remaining third to other causes†† (Figure 1).		

How do the estimated excess deaths in the US during 2020, with two-thirds attributed to COVID-19, relate to the claim that lockdowns are partly responsible for excess deaths not directly attributed to COVID-19?		
This study estimated excess deaths in the early weeks of the pandemic and the relative contribution of COVID-19 and other causes.		

What proportion of the estimated 299,028 excess deaths in the US from late January to October 3, 2020, were not attributed to COVID-19?		
Overall, an estimated 299,028 excess deaths have occurred in the United States from late January through October 3, 2020, with two thirds of these attributed to COVID-19.

Is it possible for a person to vote more than once in the US election, as claimed by the evidence of 142 cases of voter fraud in the 2018 election?		
During the 2018 election, the state found that out of 3.2 million ballots cast, there were 142 cases of voter fraud — where people had either voted more than once or cast a ballot for a deceased family member.		

Can a voter cast multiple ballots in the same election?		
A: No. Once a voter casts a ballot, the voter cannot cast another ballot. Attempting to vote more than once in the same election is a felony.		

If the claim that a man who received four ballot applications votes four times in the 2020 election is true, how many votes may have been affected by this alleged voter fraud?		
7. Determine how many votes may have been affected if the allegation is true, which in this example would be the total number of retired members who improperly voted in the election.		

How do election officials handle and account for all ballots cast in an election, including unused, sample, challenged, spoiled, and totally void ballots?		
- Although only valid ballots should be counted in determining the results of the election, election officials should account for all ballots cast in the election, including unused, sample, challenged, spoiled, and totally void ballots.		

What measures are in place to prevent and detect multiple voting attempts in the US election system?		
Because absentee ballots and early voting ballots are retrievable, if someone tries to get around the system, their ballot can be retrieved and not counted, so it will not affect the outcome of an election.		

Can a person vote more than once in an election if they have received multiple ballot applications?		
4. Review election records, such as the voter eligibility list and voter register, to determine if the retired members cited by the protesting member and any other retired members actually voted in the election.

Is the signature verification process in Washington state sufficient to prevent a voter from submitting multiple ballots?

""The weight of evidence we examined from both historical and modern analyses of the 1918 influenza pandemic favors a scenario in which viral damage followed by bacterial pneumonia led to the vast majority of deaths,"" says co-author NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. ""		

Did Dr. Anthony Fauci's research suggest that bacterial pneumonia was the primary cause of deaths during the 1918 influenza pandemic, and if so, what was the underlying factor that contributed to the development of bacterial pneumonia?		
The majority of deaths during the influenza pandemic of 1918-1919 were not caused by the influenza virus acting alone, report researchers from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health.		

What was the primary cause of most deaths in the 1918 influenza pandemic, and did Dr. Anthony Fauci's research on the pandemic suggest a link between face masks and bacterial pneumonia?		
In the most recent influenza pandemic that did not involve the use of antibiotics to suppress bacteria (the 1918–1919 pandemic), histological and bacteriologic evidence suggests that the vast majority of influenza deaths resulted from secondary bacterial pneumonia.		

Did Dr. Anthony Fauci's research suggest that face masks caused bacterial pneumonia, leading to most deaths in the 1918 influenza pandemic?		
The majority of deaths in the 1918–1919 influenza pandemic likely resulted directly from secondary bacterial pneumonia caused by common upper respiratory–tract bacteria.		

Did Dr. Anthony Fauci and other experts in 1918 attribute deaths in the influenza pandemic to bacterial pneumonia caused by the influenza virus itself, or to secondary bacterial infections that colonized the upper respiratory tract?		
Although the cause of influenza was disputed in 1918, there was almost universal agreement among experts [e.g., 20, 27–33] that deaths were virtually never caused by the unidentified etiologic agent itself, but resulted directly from severe secondary pneumonia caused by well-known bacterial “pneumopathogens” that colonized the upper respiratory tract (predominantly pneumococci, streptococci, and staphylococci).		

Did Dr. Anthony Fauci's research suggest that bacterial pneumonia was the primary cause of most deaths during the 1918 influenza pandemic, and if so, what was the role of face masks in this process?		
Based on contemporary and modern evidence, we conclude here that influenza A virus infection in conjunction with bacterial infection led to most of the deaths during the 1918–1919 pandemic.		

Does the evidence suggest that Dr. Anthony Fauci or the US government's top expert in the fight against Covid-19 knew that most deaths in the 1918 influenza pandemic originated from bacterial pneumonia caused by face masks?		
The question of whether the pathogenesis of severe influenza-associated pneumonia was primarily viral (i.e., assumed to be an unknown etiologic agent in 1918) or a combination of viral and bacterial agents was carefully considered by pathologists in 1918–1919, without definitive resolution [26, 33].		

Did Dr. Anthony Fauci's research suggest that bacterial pneumonia caused by face masks was a primary cause of deaths in the 1918 influenza pandemic?		
The published reports ""clearly and consistently implicated secondary bacterial pneumonia caused by common upper respiratory flora in most influenza fatalities,"" says Dr. Morens.		

Did Dr. Anthony Fauci's research on the 1918 influenza pandemic suggest that bacterial pneumonia was a major cause of death, and if so, what were the underlying factors that contributed to this outcome?		
We examined relevant information from the most recent influenza pandemic that occurred during the era prior to the use of antibiotics, the 1918–1919 “Spanish flu” pandemic.		

Does the evidence suggest that Dr. Anthony Fauci knew about the role of bacterial pneumonia in the 1918 influenza pandemic, and if so, does it support the claim that most deaths in the 1918 influenza pandemic originated from bacterial pneumonia caused by face masks?		
Indeed, the availability of antibiotics during the other influenza pandemics of the 20th century, specifically those of 1957 and 1968, was probably a key factor in the lower number of worldwide deaths during those outbreaks, notes Dr. Morens.

In 2016, the median wealth of white households was $171,000. That’s 10 times the wealth of black households ($17,100) – a larger gap than in 2007 – and eight times that of Hispanic households ($20,600), about the same gap as in 2007.		

How has the median wealth of white households compared to that of black households changed over time, with the median wealth of white households being 81 times that of black households?

What is the relationship between the median wealth of white households and black households in the US, and how has this gap changed over time?		
The black-white wealth gap has persisted for decades. As shown in Table 1, the median wealth for black nonretirees over the age of 25 has never amounted to more than 19 percent of the median wealth of similarly situated whites since 1989.		

What is the change in the ratio of median black wealth to median white wealth between 2013 and 2016?		
A simple calculation puts the persistent and policy-driven black-white wealth gap into perspective. Consider that the racial wealth gap—measured as the ratio of median black wealth to median white wealth—slightly narrowed from 2013 to 2016.		

What is the ratio of the median wealth held by a typical white household in the US compared to that of a typical black household?		
In relative terms, Black households hold only 6 percent of the wealth owned by white households, which amounts to a total wealth gap of $104,033, and Latino households hold only 8 percent of the wealth owned by white households, a wealth gap of $102,798 (see Figure 1).

115,More people who wear masks become sick with COVID-19 compared to non-mask wearers,"Does the World Health Organization recommend wearing masks in areas of widespread COVID-19 transmission, and if so, does this contradict the claim that more people who wear masks become sick with COVID-19 compared to non-mask wearers?		
Even the cautious and consensus-driven World Health Organization, which initially recommended against masks, now encourages their use in areas of widespread COVID-19 transmission137, in light of new information on the disease and the results of large-scale comparative studies135.		

Does the study by MacIntyre and others (2015) suggest that wearing masks increases the risk of contracting COVID-19?		
One specific study is worth mentioning here, because of how often it is brought up in discussions of masks: MacIntyre and others 2015, ""Facemasks for the prevention of infection in healthcare and community settings.		

Does wearing a mask increase the risk of contracting COVID-19?		
- There is now convincing evidence from multiple controlled experiments5–7 and field observations8–14 that wearing masks reduces the transmission of COVID-19 for healthcare workers and the public.		

Does the evidence support the claim that more people who wear masks become sick with COVID-19 compared to non-mask wearers?		
This is not true. A very recent systematic review by Macintyre and Chughtai7 of public masking studies (including many RCTs) concluded that masks are effective at slowing the spread of many respiratory diseases.		

Is there a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 among individuals who wear masks compared to those who do not wear masks?		
The secondary attack rate among health care workers who unknowingly care for a patient with COVID-19 while wearing face masks alone or not using any personal protective equipment is also low; transmission studies suggest less than 3% (and the few health care worker infections that were documented in these transmission studies were associated with aerosol-generating procedures or prolonged exposures with inconsistent use of face masks).5,6 People infected with SARS-CoV-2 may be producing both droplets and aerosols on a constant basis but most of these emissions are not infecting other people.		

Does the widespread use of masks in Hubei province, China, before and during the COVID-19 outbreak lead to an increase in the number of people who become sick with COVID-19?		
Sweeping mask recommendations—as many have proposed—will not reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission, as evidenced by the widespread practice of wearing such masks in Hubei province, China, before and during its mass COVID-19 transmission experience earlier this year.		

Does the meta-analysis provide direct evidence that wearing masks, including N95 respirators and medical masks, increases the risk of contracting COVID-19?		
A recent meta-analysis made this claim.8 However, the meta-analysis was not based on direct comparisons of N95 respirators vs medical masks but rather on a post hoc bayesian analysis of 2 independent analyses, one on N95 respirators vs no masks and the other on medical masks vs no masks.		

What is the association between universal masking and the growth of COVID-19 cases in the study involving 75,000 participants?		
This large study involved 75,000 participants, including healthcare workers and patients. Of all the public health interventions, universal masking appears to be the most associated with stopping the exponential growth of COVID-19 cases, first flattening and then decreasing the infection rate8.		

Does the evidence suggest that wearing masks is associated with a higher or lower risk of contracting COVID-19?		
There is also recent evidence that masking is effective at state and national levels. In countries where public masking was common before the pandemic (where it was culturally normal for sick people to wear masks in public), COVID-19 had an initial daily growth rate of 10%, versus 18% in countries without such norms10,61,62.		

Does the evidence suggest that wearing masks is associated with an increased risk of contracting COVID-19, or does it suggest that mask mandates are effective in reducing the spread of the virus?		
However, recent studies have shown decreased cases of COVID-19 in areas where masks and social distancing are mandated, and experts say that the efficacy of these mandates will only increase over time13,14,23,77.

Biden’s campaign has focused on a short video clip circulated by the Sanders campaign of a Biden speech in 2018 in which he appears to express praise for former House Speaker Paul Ryan’s tax plan passed during Trump’s presidency — words that the Biden campaign says were delivered sarcastically.		

Is Joe Biden running for the Senate or a different office?		
""Joe Biden has been lying about his personal life for decades,"" Parscale wrote in the caption of the video, which has been shared tens of thousands of times.		

What did Joe Biden say about his motivations for running for office?		
Given the way certain phrases were delivered and a fuller context of Biden’s comments, it was misleading for a Sanders campaign staffer to claim that Biden said “‘Ryan was correct’ to go after Social Security & Medicare.”		

Was the video and transcript shared by the Sanders campaign accurately representing Joe Biden's statement about running for office?		
“The Sanders campaign pushed a video and transcript that were intentionally, deceptively edited to make it seem like Vice President Biden was praising and agreeing with Paul Ryan, when it is clear he was doing the exact opposite,” a Biden campaign official told us.

What is Joe Biden's current political affiliation according to his statement?

Did Joe Biden express a willingness to make cuts to Medicare in his comments from the Senate floor on November 16, 1995?

The Catholic Church has been at the forefront of fostering curiosity about space from early on. The Gregorian calendar, which we use today to calculate the time the planet takes to orbit around the sun, was promulgated by Pope Gregory XIII, and at least 35 craters on the surface of the moon are named after Jesuit scientists who advanced humanity’s understanding of the universe.		

Does NASA always receive blessings from the Pope before a space mission?		
Today – nearly 50 years later – as Pope Francis prepares to speak to six astronauts currently on the International Space Station on Oct. 26, it’s a good moment to look back at when popes sent prayers and tokens beyond Earth’s stratosphere, and the times when little pieces of the cosmos, taken from the unknown boundaries of space, made it back.		

Does the Pope's blessing or permission play a role in NASA's space missions?		
Now six years later, Francis will also become part of the Church’s ancient bond with space, and his words will likely stand on the “shoulders of giants,” such as Paul VI and Benedict XVI, who, among many others, paved the way for Catholicism to gaze beyond the far reaches of the universe.		

Does the Pope's blessing of NASA astronauts imply that NASA always receives blessings from the Pope and that God's permission must be sought before a space mission?

Does the Pope always bless NASA's space missions before they depart?		
Paul VI had blessed the voyage of Apollo 11 on its departure on July 16, kept them in his prayers, and referred to the mission often during his weekly general audiences.		

Did the Pope prepare questions for NASA astronauts on a wide range of topics, including faith?		
Benedict XVI prepared a set of questions in English for the astronauts on a wide range of topics including the environment, war and faith.		

Does NASA always receive a blessing from the Pope before a space mission?		
Pope Paul VI sent a greeting to the moon with Apollo 11's Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin in 1969, but it was in a silicon disk that contained goodwill messages from numerous countries and was left on the Sea of Tranquility.		

Does NASA always receive blessings from the Pope and seek God's permission before a space mission?		
In 2011, Benedict XVI became the first pope to speak to astronauts in space.

Does NASA always receive blessings from the Pope and seek God's permission before a space mission?		
Though the press did report the fact that Aldrin would bring communion bread on the spacecraft, he kept the ceremony low-key and, out of respect for the debate over religion on the moon, kept the ceremony confined to the spacecraft and not the surface of the moon.		

Does the Pope always send blessings to NASA before a space mission?

The claim that Robert E. Lee did not own slaves is often paired with the claim that Ulysses S. Grant did own slaves during the Civil War.

126,"Ulysses S. Grant, commander of the Union Army during the American Civil War, was a slave owner.","Did Ulysses S. Grant own an enslaved individual?		
As a result, Ulysses Grant was the last U.S. president to have owned an enslaved individual. Grant’s legacy as the respected Commanding General of the Union Army, and his efforts as president to protect black citizenship have long obscured his personal slave-ownership, as well as that of his beloved wife.		

Did Ulysses S. Grant own a slave at any point in his life?		
At some time before the Civil War, Grant himself owned a slave named William Jones. We know this not because the Grant correspondence mentions it, as his letters up until the Civil War do not mention his opinions on slavery nor discuss the status of slaves, but because he manumitted Jones on March 29, 1859.		

Did Ulysses S. Grant personally own slaves?		
Grant was the last US president to have personally owned another human being. Though his father was an abolitionist, Grant married a woman from a slave-owning family and personally directed the labor of enslaved workers at their plantation in Missouri.		

How did Ulysses S. Grant come to own a slave?		
Grant came to own that slave through his wife’s family. When Ulysses Grant and Julia Dent married on August 22, 1848, Grant was pursuing a military career, having recently returned from the Mexican-American War.		

Did Ulysses S. Grant own slaves before the 13th amendment was passed in December 1865?		
U.S. Grant had several slaves who were only freed after the 13th amendment in December of 1865. When asked why he didn’t free his slaves earlier, Grant stated that “Good help is so hard to come by these days.”		

Did Ulysses S. Grant own only one slave in his lifetime and free it, despite having the opportunity to sell it for financial gain?		
The perhaps surprising answer is Ulysses S. Grant. As far as is known, Grant owned only one slave in his lifetime, and he freed that slave even though at the time Grant was in a dire financial situation and could have made some much needed money by selling his slave.		

Did Ulysses S. Grant, commander of the Union Army during the American Civil War, ever own slaves?		
Though Grant himself grew up in an abolitionist family in the free state of Ohio, his marriage to Julia Dent led him to become involved in slavery while the two lived in Missouri on Julia’s family estate.		

Did Ulysses S. Grant own a slave named William Jones at some point during the late 1850s?		
At some time during the late 1850s, Grant came to own a slave named William Jones. It is not certain when this occurred or why, but most likely Grant’s ownership of Jones was through purchase or as a gift from his father-in-law.		

Did Ulysses S. Grant own slaves during the American Civil War?		
The proponents of the myth that Ulysses S. Grant owned slaves during the War do so to obscure the historical record that the overwhelming reason given by southerners for seceding from the Union was to protect the institution of slavery, an institution that had expanded beyond southern borders.		

Did Ulysses S. Grant, commander of the Union Army during the American Civil War, ever own slaves?

Does Joe Biden propose a 2% property tax increase, or is this a policy proposal from another presidential candidate?		
The wealth tax has been one of Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s signature policy proposals on the campaign trail, what she sells as a “two-cent tax” on the 75,000 wealthiest families in the country: She’s proposing a 2 percent tax on household assets above $50 million and 3 percent for households with assets worth more than $1 billion.

Democrats are more likely than Republicans to favor raising tax rates on household income over $250,000.

Top Democrats including Joe Biden and James Clyburn have spoken out against violence at Black Lives Matter demonstrations, as have some leaders of the movement itself.		

Does the evidence suggest that Antifa has been officially designated as a terrorist organization by the US government?		
Evidence for Antifa violence during these protests has not yet been provided. Amid the protests, Trump sought to declare Antifa a terrorist organization, although the U.S. government can currently only declare foreign groups as terrorist organizations—not to mention that Antifa has no single, central structure.

Did Black Lives Matter endorse US Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, and if so, what was the nature of this endorsement?		
The campaign aimed to maximize the impact of the BLM movement by galvanizing BLM supporters and allies to the polls in the 2020 U.S Presidential Election to build collective power and ensure candidates are held accountable for the issues that systematically and disproportionately impact Black and under-served communities across the nation.		

Is Antifa a group that can provide endorsements, and if so, what is the significance of Antifa's endorsement in the context of Joe Biden's presidential campaign?		
In addition, Antifa is not a “group” per se, but rather a decentralized network of individuals. Consequently, it is unlikely that designating Antifa as a terrorist organization would even have much of an impact.

135,No one lost their health care because of the Wellmark and Iowa Farm Bureau Health Plan Bill.,"What type of health insurance policies did Wellmark and the Iowa Farm Bureau Federation sell in Iowa, and how did they differ from other health insurance policies in the state?		
The Iowa situation became even more complicated this spring, when Iowa legislators approved a controversial plan to let Wellmark partner with the Iowa Farm Bureau Federation to sell 2019 policies that don’t comply with Affordable Care Act regulations or state rules.		

Did Medica object to the Wellmark and Iowa Farm Bureau Health Plan Bill because it would allow Wellmark and Farm Bureau to sell unregulated policies that technically aren’t health insurance?		
Medica objected to the bill allowing Wellmark and Farm Bureau to sell unregulated policies that technically aren’t health insurance.		

Did Wellmark Blue Cross initially withdraw from the Iowa market, or did it remain out of the market before eventually re-entering in 2017?		
This left Medica and Wellmark Blue Cross. Initially, Wellmark remained out of the Iowa market but as other insurers withdrew, it decided to enter for 2017.		

Did the Wellmark and Iowa Farm Bureau Health Plan Bill lead to any individuals losing their healthcare coverage in Iowa?		
The situation in Iowa has improved, however. Wellmark reentered the market for 2019, noting that legislative and regulatory uncertainty has ""dissipated just enough that we think we're able to step back in,"" as long as ""there aren't any significant changes to the ACA"" (Ramm 2018).		

Did the Wellmark and Iowa Farm Bureau Health Plan Bill result in any individuals losing their healthcare coverage?		
Farm Bureau members who live in Iowa now have access to an affordable healthcare option. Farm Bureau Health Plan offers comprehensive benefits and a broad provider network at rates that could save you as much as 50% compared to other plans available in the market.		

What was the relationship between the Iowa Farm Bureau's decision to allow Wellmark to sell non-ACA-compliant coverage and the potential impact on health care coverage for individuals?		
Informed speculation also suggests that Wellmark's reentry decision was tied to the state's decision to allow it to start selling non-ACA-compliant coverage through the Farm Bureau.		

Did the Wellmark and Iowa Farm Bureau Health Plan Bill have any impact on the availability of health insurance options in Iowa?		
In Iowa, for instance, several sources noted that insurers were nervous about being in a market where cost-sharing payments were being used as a political bargaining chip, but Medica, now the state's only insurer, decided not to withdraw after the insurance department allowed it to file contingency (backup) rates.

136,Forty percent of Iowa’s energy resources are from renewables.,"What percentage of Iowa's electricity net generation comes from renewable resources?		
More than two-fifths of Iowa's electricity net generation comes from renewable resources, almost all of it from wind.23 In 2019, the state was the third-largest wind power producer, after Texas and Oklahoma.		

What percentage of Iowa's electric net generation comes from wind energy?		
About 42% of Iowa’s electric net generation comes from wind, the largest share of any state.		

What percentage of Iowa's energy resources come from renewable energy resources, excluding wind energy?		
In 2019, about 2% of Iowa's electricity net generation came from renewable energy resources other than wind.		

What percentage of Iowa's energy resources were from renewable sources at the beginning of 2020?		
Capacity from eligible renewable resources has far exceeded the RPS goals. At the beginning of 2020, Iowa had about 10,400 megawatts of generating capacity fueled by renewable sources at utility-scale power facilities.39		

What percentage of Iowa's energy resources come from wind energy?		
Wind energy from about 5,100 turbines powered 42% of Iowa's net generation, the highest share of any state, as more wind power generating capacity came online.24,25,26		

What percentage of Iowa's energy resources come from renewable sources?		
In Iowa, renewable energy produced by wind turbines provides 57% of the power needed in the state.		

What percentage of Iowa's energy resources come from wind power?		
Iowa wind has surpassed the milestone of generating 20 percent and now generates 34% of the state's electricity from wind.		

What percentage of Iowa's energy resources come from renewable sources, according to the evidence?		
Since 2008, Iowa has generated more electricity each year than the state consumed.47 Almost half of electricity retail sales in Iowa go to the industrial sector, nearly three-tenths of power sales are to the residential sector, and the commercial sector accounts for about one-fourth.48 Iowa's average electricity price for all sectors is below the median price for the states.49 About one in five Iowa households rely on electricity for home heating.50

137,it is unknown whether a person under 20 can pass the disease to an older adult.,"Does the evidence suggest that people under 20 are less likely to show clinical symptoms of COVID-19 compared to adults, which could potentially affect their ability to pass the disease to older adults?		
The extent of truly asymptomatic infection in the community remains unknown. The proportion of people whose infection is asymptomatic likely varies with age due to the increasing prevalence of underlying conditions in older age groups (and thus increasing risk of developing severe disease with increasing age), and studies that show that children are less likely to show clinical symptoms compared to adults.(76)		

Can asymptomatic children under 20 years old transmit the SARS-COV-2 virus to older adults?		
However, it is highly likely that children can transmit the SARS-COV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, and even asymptomatic children can have viral loads.		

What is the current understanding of the transmission dynamics of the disease, particularly with regards to the possibility of a person under 20 passing it to an older adult?		
Transmission can also occur from people who are infected and remain asymptomatic, but the extent to which this occurs is not fully understood and requires further research as an urgent priority.		

Does the evidence suggest that people under 20 are unable to pass COVID-19 to older adults?		
People of any age can catch COVID-19. But it most commonly affects middle-aged and older adults. The risk of developing dangerous symptoms increases with age, with those who are age 85 and older are at the highest risk of serious symptoms.		

Does the evidence suggest that a person under 20 can pass the disease to an older adult?		
An increase in the percentage of positive test results in older age groups is likely to result in more hospitalizations, severe illnesses, and deaths.¶ These findings corroborate regional patterns in the southern United States, where increased percent positivity among adults aged 20–39 years preceded increases among those aged ≥60 years (2); provide evidence that among young adults, those aged 18–24 years demonstrate the earliest increases in percent positivity; and underscore the importance of reducing transmission from younger populations to those at highest risk for severe illness or death.		

What does the evidence suggest about the transmission of the disease from a person under 20 to an older adult?		
Transmission from infected people without symptoms is difficult to study. However, information can be gathered from detailed contact tracing efforts, as well as epidemiologic investigations among cases and contacts.		

How does the evidence suggest that young adults may be contributing to the transmission of COVID-19 to older adults?		
There is an urgent need to address transmission among young adult populations, especially given recent increases in COVID-19 incidence among young adults (3).		

What factors are being researched to understand the transmission of the disease, including the role of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals, and how do these factors relate to the claim that it is unknown whether a person under 20 can pass the disease to an older adult?		
As research continues, we expect to gain a better understanding about the relative importance of different transmission routes, including through droplets, physical contact and fomites; the role of airborne transmission in the absence of aerosol generating procedures; the dose of virus required for transmission to occur, the characteristics of people and situations that facilitate superspreading events such as those observed in various closed settings, the proportion of infected people who remain asymptomatic throughout the course of their infection; the proportion of truly asymptomatic persons who transmit the virus to others; the specific factors that drive asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission; and the proportion of all infections that are transmitted from asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals.		

Is it established whether a person under 20 can transmit the disease to an older adult?		
While someone who never develops symptoms can also pass the virus to others, it is still not clear to what extent this occurs and more research is needed in this area.		

Are individuals under 20 more or less likely to transmit the virus to an older adult compared to individuals with symptoms?		
Information from contact tracing efforts reported to WHO by Member States, available transmission studies and a recent pre-print systematic reviews suggests that individuals without symptoms are less likely to transmit the virus than those who develop symptoms.(10, 81, 84, 85) Four individual studies from Brunei, Guangzhou China, Taiwan China and the Republic of Korea found that between 0% and 2.2% of people with asymptomatic infection infected anyone else, compared to 0.8%-15.4% of people with symptoms.(10, 72, 86, 87)

Second, the amended version includes a provision backed by Senator Ted Cruz, which would eviscerate protections for people with pre-existing conditions in the individual market and drastically raise premiums for comprehensive plans that cover critical benefits.		

What specific provisions of the Affordable Care Act does John Cornyn's plan maintain, according to the evidence?		
The plan does keep some of the Affordable Care Act's most popular provisions, including barring insurers from denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions and allowing people to stay on a parent's health insurance plan until age 26.		

What specific provision in John Cornyn's plan would ensure that insurers must sell plans to any patient with pre-existing conditions and guarantee coverage for them?

Does John Cornyn's plan guarantee that insurers must sell plans to any patient with preexisting conditions, as claimed in his campaign ad, or does it actually allow insurers to sell non-ACA plans that may not comply with consumer protections?		
The Cruz amendment would allow any insurer offering at least one plan satisfying Affordable Care Act (ACA) market reforms and consumer protections to also sell other, non-ACA plans in the individual market that do not comply with these standards.		

Does John Cornyn's plan guarantee that insurers must sell plans to any patient with preexisting conditions, as claimed in his campaign ad video?

How does the age distribution of COVID-19 deaths, as reported in the evidence, relate to the claim that COVID-19 has caused zero deaths in people under 20?		
Early data from China suggest that a majority of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) deaths have occurred among adults aged ≥60 years and among persons with serious underlying health conditions.		

What is the relationship between the age group and the risk of severe COVID-19–associated illness and death, according to the evidence from China?		
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic (2). Data from China have indicated that older adults, particularly those with serious underlying health conditions, are at higher risk for severe COVID-19–associated illness and death than are younger persons (3).		

What is the age distribution of COVID-19 deaths according to the CDC data as of July 22, 2020?		
To examine the extent of state-level variation in the share of COVID-19 deaths accounted for by older adults, we analyze the distribution of COVID-19 deaths by age group at the state level, based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as of July 22, 2020, for the week ending July 11.		

What is the age range of individuals who have died from COVID-19, according to the evidence provided?		
- The initial estimates of the case fatality rate of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from China and the published modelled estimates both show a very strong age-dependence.1,2 In the UK, this pattern has been interpreted in public health terms as advice to cocoon (ie, isolate) those older than 70 years and those with underlying health conditions—but is this the right age cutoff?		

What is the estimated case fatality ratio of COVID-19 in China, and how does it relate to the claim that COVID-19 had caused zero deaths in people under 20?		
However, after adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment, they estimated the case fatality ratio (the percentage of people with symptomatic or confirmed disease who die from the disease) in China as 1.38% (1.23% to 1.53%).

Germany shared samples and data from the Navalny case with the OPCW, which conducts its own lab tests.		

What is the relationship between the OPCW's investigation in Douma and the Navalny case?		
The OPCW was also due to conduct analysis of the chemical weapons attack in Douma on 7 April. This operation in The Hague by the GRU was not an isolated act.		

What is the purpose of the OPCW inspectors in Syria, as stated in the evidence?		
In recent weeks, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) has appeared across international headlines, as inspectors from the OPCW have been deployed to Syria to establish the facts around the allegations of chemical weapons attack in Douma, Syria.		

How does the evidence support the claim that the OPCW scenario of the Navalny case is a planned conspiracy scenario?		
K. whereas the Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin hospital has concluded that Alexei Navalny was poisoned with a nerve agent from the Novichok group, which is a military grade of nerve agents developed by the Soviet Union and the Russian Federation; whereas this finding has been confirmed by a specialised laboratory of the German armed forces and multiple laboratories working independently; whereas the Novichok nerve agent was recently used in March 2018 on the territory of the EU in an attack on the former Russian intelligence operative Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia Skripal in Salisbury, United Kingdom, which also resulted in the accidental death of Amesbury resident Dawn Sturgess;		

Does Germany believe that the Navalny case is a violation of international law prohibiting the use of chemical weapons?		
As such, Germany views the Navalny case as a violation of “international law prohibiting the use of chemical weapons” and thus “sees no reason” for handing evidence over to Russia, the German government’s deputy spokeswoman Martina Fietz has said.		

Does the OPCW Director-General's decision to review the relevant literature and clarify the definition of parent compounds and other chemicals related to the ""novichok"" nomenclature support or contradict the claim that the OPCW scenario of the Navalny case is a fantastic story and a planned conspiracy scenario?		
Meanwhile, OPCW Director-General Ahmet Üzümcü has tasked the organization’s Scientific Advisory Board to review the relevant literature and to clarify the definition of parent compounds and other chemicals that fall under the “novichok” nomenclature.		

How do the biomarkers found in Mr. Navalny's system relate to the Novichok agents mentioned in the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) Annex?		
Biomarkers found in Mr. Navalny’s system showed that the agent used against him, while not listed in the CWC Annex, held structural characteristics similar to those of the Novichok agents in schedules 1.A.14 and 1.A.15.		

What is the OPCW's plan regarding the alleged substance used in the Navalny case?		
The OPCW will make an independent assessment of the alleged substance used in the incident.

176,Tax avoidance costs £90 billion per year.,"How much more does HMRC estimate that tax avoidance costs annually, according to their previous reports?		
These figures are outside the scope of HMRC estimates. How much more is there? It’s hard to say. But if HMRC say that there are avoidance costs of at least £1.7bn in previous reports - which will not include the above two figures for reasons already noted.		

What is the estimated annual cost of corporate profit shifting from the UK, according to the evidence provided?		
Based on the work of Alex Cobham and Peter Jansky, in turn based on IMF based estimates, corporate profit shifting from the UK may be a surprisingly low £1 billion a year (other countries, like Germany and France, suffer a great deal more).		

Does the evidence suggest that the £90 billion figure for tax avoidance includes both declared but unpaid tax and errors in tax payment, in addition to tax evasion?		
Then add in HMRC’s admitted rate of non-payment of £3.4 billion, which is tax declared but not paid, and the £3.2 billion not paid due to errors, which would not show up in shadow economy data as this relates to declared activity.		

How does the estimated tax gap due to the shadow economy relate to the claim that tax avoidance costs £90 billion per year?		
The resulting tax gap due to the shadow economy was, based on a euro UK GDP of €2,602bn, between £60.2bn and £66.7bn.		

What does HMRC say about the tax gap in 2015?		
HMRC said that in 2015, the year to which my data relates, the VAT tax gap was 9.8%. I think we can agree that the difference is pretty insignificant.		

What proportion of the estimated £90 billion annual tax gap is attributed to evasion by the very wealthiest in the UK?		
Based on his work I have estimated that evasion by the very wealthiest in the UK may amount to up to £7 billion a year.		

How does HMRC's estimate of tax avoidance costs account for the fact that 800,000 income tax returns and at least 400,000 corporation tax returns are not submitted each year?		
So HMRC audit inefficiency is built into the estimates as a result. And third, they simply ignore the fact that 800,000 or so income tax returns and at least 400,000 corporation tax returns are simply not submitted each year: the estimates for losses from these are negligible but, most especially with regard to companies may well account for a considerable part of the tax evaded.		

What is the source of the alternative estimate of the UK tax gap mentioned in the evidence?		
So let me suggest an alternative estimate of the UK tax gap in advance of HMRC's claim. This is based on the work I did for the European Union Socialists and Democrats group of MEPs in the EU parliament published in January this year, here.		

What is the basis for HMRC's estimate of the tax gap, according to the evidence?		
Let me summarise why. First, HMRC's estimate of the VAT gap tends to be sound: it is based on macroeconomic data.		

Does the evidence suggest that the claim that tax avoidance costs £90 billion per year is accurate?		
I can make a fairly confident prediction. The figure will be around £33 billion, simply because ever since this data was first published in 2010 the tax gap has never been below £27 billion and has never gone above £35 billion.

Have there been any reported instances of the PLAAF intercepting or engaging with foreign aircraft, including Indian Sukhoi Su-30 fighter jets, in the past?		
Chinese bomber pilots have discussed being intercepted by foreign aircraft, unnamed but possibly from the United States, on flights in the South China Sea and the Western Pacific, so the potential for miscalculation and inadvertent escalation is real.		

Has the PLAAF (People's Liberation Army Air Force) shot down an Indian Sukhoi Su-30 fighter jet in Tibet, according to the evidence provided?		
As far as the Su-27/30 crashes are concerned, there has been a long thread on that. The only authoritative figure is Jane's which confirmed only five a/c written off from the Sukhoi fleet with two crashes and three damaged by a typhoon.		

Has the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) engaged in any military exercises or activities in Tibet that could be related to the claim that it shot down an Indian Sukhoi Su-30 fighter jet?

Does the evidence suggest that the PLAAF has the capability to shoot down an Indian Sukhoi Su-30 fighter jet in Tibet?

A principal finding of our report is that Mexican security forces have committed widespread abuses in the context of counternarcotics operations, including the systematic use of torture in five states.		

What is the evidence of state involvement in disappearances in Mexico, according to Human Rights Watch?		
Human Rights Watch has documented 249 disappearances committed in Mexico since December 2006. In 149 of these cases, we found compelling evidence that state actors participated in the crime, either acting on their own or collaborating with criminal groups.		

Is Mexico on a ""red alert"" with children being targeted for kidnapping so their organs can be harvested, according to the evidence provided?		
Yet the report does not purport to comment on the “entire” country. Rather, it addresses abuses in the context of President Calderón’s “war on drugs” (which has affected some regions of the country significantly more than others), based on findings from five of the states where federal security forces have undertaken some of their largest interventions, and which account for 43 percent of drug-related violence in the country (according to the most recent available official statistics).		

Are there any credible reports or evidence of cartels targeting children for kidnapping and organ harvesting in Mexico?		
Given that cartels have committed serious crimes in Mexico in recent years, including many disappearances, it is reasonable for prosecutors to investigate the possibility that the perpetrators of such crimes are members of criminal groups.		

What types of abuses, including cases of grave abuses, are documented in the report, and which security forces are implicated in these abuses?		
[488] We disagree. Our report documents more than 230 cases in which Mexican security forces are implicated in grave abuses—including cases from five different states, and cases involving every type of security force involved in counternarcotics operations (the Army, Navy, and the federal, state, and local police).		

What is the evidence suggesting about the involvement of security forces in child abductions in Mexico?		
Human Rights Watch found this occurs even in cases where initial evidence suggests the participation of security forces in abductions, demonstrating a flagrant disregard for families’ safety.		

Is there any evidence to suggest that Mexico is experiencing a widespread issue with children being targeted for kidnapping and organ harvesting, or is the claim based on unfounded allegations?		
Mexico has obligations under the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance to ensure not only the right to report the facts of a disappearance to the competent authorities and a prompt, thorough impartial investigation of the report, but also to take measures to protect anyone—including the complainant—participating in the investigation, from any ill-treatment or intimidation as a consequence of the complaint.[273]		

Are there any indications of state involvement in the reported cases of children being targeted for kidnapping and organ harvesting in Mexico?		
We are not aware of evidence of the participation of state actors in these crimes. However, given the widespread involvement of police and military personnel evidenced in other disappearances, in the absence of thorough investigations, it is impossible to rule out the participation of state actors in these cases.		

Did the Mexican government have a system in place to track and coordinate investigations of missing persons, including children, before the claim was made?		
In spite of clear evidence of mounting disappearances, indications that federal and state governments lack the tools to coordinate investigations at a national level, and the recommendations of monitoring organizations, the Calderón administration for years did not attempt to set up a national database of the disappeared.		

Is there a connection between the alleged ""red alert"" and the lack of criminalization of enforced disappearances in Mexico's Military Code of Justice?		
Furthermore, Mexico’s Military Code of Justice does not criminalize enforced disappearances. Because cases of alleged disappearances perpetrated by the military in Mexico are virtually always investigated in the military justice system, this absence results in a serious gap in relevant legislation.[449]

191,Flu shots lead to severe or life-threatening conditions making them unsafe.,"Does the evidence suggest that flu shots increase the risk of severe or life-threatening conditions?		
No. Studies show that the flu shot does not cause an increased risk for miscarriage. This comes from one of the largest studies examining influenza vaccination and the risk of miscarriage conducted by the CDC in 2019.		

Can the benefits of flu shots in preventing serious illness, hospitalization, and death outweigh the risks of severe or life-threatening conditions associated with the vaccine?		
The potential benefits of influenza vaccination in preventing serious illness, hospitalization, and death substantially outweigh these estimates of risk for vaccine-associated GBS.		

Is there scientific evidence that flu shots lead to severe or life-threatening conditions, making them unsafe?		
No scientific evidence indicates that thimerosal in vaccines, including influenza vaccines, is a cause of adverse events other than occasional local hypersensitivity reactions in vaccine recipients.		

Does the evidence suggest that flu shots are unsafe, or does it only suggest that a potential link between flu shots and severe or life-threatening conditions cannot be confidently ruled out?		
While the weight of epidemiologic evidence does not support a causal link between influenza vaccinations evaluated over the last 30 years, an association cannot be confidently ruled out, particularly for future vaccine strains.		

Does the evidence suggest that flu shots increase the risk of severe or life-threatening conditions, making them unsafe?		
The authors concluded that vaccination against influenza does not increase the risk of GBS incidence within 42 days of immunization, but noted the study was underpowered to assess a small increase in the background incidence.		

Does the evidence suggest that flu shots increase the risk of severe or life-threatening conditions, or are the reported cases of worsening symptoms after vaccination generally mild and potentially unrelated to the vaccination itself?		
Whether influenza vaccination specifically might increase the risk for recurrence of GBS is unknown. Among 311 patients with GBS who responded to a survey, 11 (4%) reported some worsening of symptoms after influenza vaccination; however, some of these patients had received other vaccines at the same time, and recurring symptoms were generally mild (317).		

Does the evidence suggest that flu shots are unsafe due to the risk of severe or life-threatening conditions?		
The benefits of influenza vaccination for all recommended groups, including pregnant women and young children, outweigh concerns on the basis of a theoretic risk from thimerosal exposure through vaccination.		

Does the evidence provided by the CDC support the claim that flu shots lead to severe or life-threatening conditions, or does it suggest that flu shots are actually safe and effective in reducing the risk of flu-associated acute respiratory illnesses?		
For example, the CDC reports that vaccination has been shown to cut the risk of pregnant women developing flu-associated acute respiratory illnesses by about one-half.		

Did the study conclude that flu shots lead to severe or life-threatening conditions, making them unsafe?		
The authors concluded that influenza vaccination is not associated with an increased risk of GBS in adults; however, they noted that this association was not the primary goal of the study.

While rare, infection with influenza has been associated with encephalitis (Treanor, 2010). The committee considers the effects of natural infection one type of mechanistic evidence.

- Postelection audits: In 2018, a review of returned absentee ballot records helped identify anomalies in the election results of Bladen County, North Carolina, enabling election officials to uncover election interference by a political operative who stole and tampered with mail ballots.		

How common are ballot rejections due to signature mismatch, and could this potentially impact the outcome of close elections in the 2020 U.S Presidential Election?		
Disqualification of ballots is not widespread but could make a difference in very close elections. Nationally, 1.4 percent of mail ballots were rejected in 2018, with 67,000 thrown out for signature mismatch (the third-most common reason behind “other reasons” and lateness).		

Is there a correlation between the increase in mail-in voting and the occurrence of voter fraud in the United States?		
Despite this dramatic increase in mail voting over time, fraud rates remain infinitesimally small. None of the five states that hold their elections primarily by mail has had any voter fraud scandals since making that change.		

What is the likelihood of voter fraud occurring when mail-in ballots are sent in error to previous tenants in Washington DC, based on the experience of Washington State's Director of Elections?		
Based on her experience as Washington State’s Director of Elections, Lori Augino added that “Of the nearly 3.2 million ballots cast [in Washington in 2018], only 0.004% of the total ballots cast may have been fraudulent.”

What is the rate of voter fraud in states that use vote-by-mail systems, and how does it compare to the potential for fraud caused by mail-in ballots being sent in error to previous tenants in Washington DC?		
As the New York Times editorial board notes, “states that use vote-by-mail have encountered essentially zero fraud: Oregon, the pioneer in this area, has sent out more than 100 million mail-in ballots since 2000, and has documented only about a dozen cases of proven fraud.”		

What is the most common myth about absentee voting, according to election officials?		
Each of the three election officials said the most common myth about absentee voting is that mail-in ballots are more susceptible to voter fraud.		

What steps are taken to address and resolve issues with mail-in ballots, such as signature irregularities, to prevent potential voter fraud?		
- “First, we contact the voter to mitigate the specific issue,” Augino said. Contacting voters about signature irregularities, or curing, is an essential part of any absentee voting process as it gives voters a chance to fix ballot errors before discarding them entirely.		

What percentage of voters in Colorado, Oregon, and Washington returned their mail-in ballots to a physical location in the 2016 election?		
According to the Survey of the Performance of American Elections at Harvard University in 2016, 73 percent of voters in Colorado, 59 percent in Oregon, and 65 percent in Washington returned their ballots to some physical location, such as a drop box or local election office.

236,"Covid 19 Will Go Away If You Stop Getting Tested, It's Just The Elderly Dying and People Are Being Intentionally Infected","Does the evidence suggest that stopping testing is an effective way to eliminate the spread of COVID-19?		
Therefore, COVID-19 can spread quickly in these communities, and the impact of that spread is great. Testing, particularly of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals, is key to interrupting this spread.		

Does the claim that COVID-19 will go away if people stop getting tested, and it's just the elderly dying and people being intentionally infected, accurately reflect the purpose of COVID-19 testing?		
Testing of all people for SARS-CoV-2, including those who have no symptoms, who show symptoms of infection such as trouble breathing, fever, sore throat or loss of the sense of smell and taste, and who may have been exposed to the virus will help prevent the spread of COVID-19 by identifying people who are in need of care in a timely fashion.		

Is there any scientific evidence to support the claim that COVID-19 will go away if people stop getting tested, and that the elderly are dying from other causes, and people are being intentionally infected?		
COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus. Scientists first identified this virus in December 2019. From January 2020 until May 2023, COVID-19 was a federal public health emergency in the United States.		

How does the claim relate to the evidence provided, which suggests that vaccination can prevent severe illness from COVID-19, and what is the logical connection between the claim and the evidence?		
Also, vaccination can prevent severe illness from COVID-19. But misinformation continues to circulate about COVID-19 vaccines and ways to prevent infection with the COVID-19 virus.		

What does the evidence suggest about the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the effectiveness of testing in stopping the pandemic?		
Since it is recognized that nearly half of all SARS-CoV-2 infections are transmitted by people who are not showing any symptoms, identifying infected individuals while they are presymptomatic, as well as those who are asymptomatic, will play a major role in stopping the pandemic.		

What is the relationship between the claim that COVID-19 will go away if people stop getting tested and the evidence that COVID-19 can have serious, life-threatening complications?		
COVID-19 can have serious, life-threatening complications and there is no way to know how COVID-19 will affect you.		

What are the potential consequences of COVID-19 infection, even in children, according to the evidence?		
- Getting sick with COVID-19 can cause severe illness or death, even in children, but it is not possible to determine who will experience mild or severe illness from COVID-19 infection.		

Can getting tested for COVID-19 prevent people from getting very sick if they contract the virus?		
Anyone can get COVID-19. However, some people are more likely than others to get very sick if they get COVID-19.		

How does the spread of COVID-19 occur, according to the evidence provided, and does this support or contradict the claim that COVID-19 will go away if people stop getting tested?		
COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, a coronavirus discovered in 2019. The virus spreads mainly from person to person through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks.		

Can stopping COVID-19 testing and following public health practices such as wearing a mask, washing hands, and maintaining physical distance help control the COVID-19 pandemic?		
One thing we know for sure – every single person can help our country control the COVID-19 pandemic. From wearing a mask to washing your hands to maintaining physical distance and avoiding large indoor gatherings, each of us can follow proven public health practices that not only reduce our own chance of getting infected by SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes coronavirus disease, or COVID-19), but also prevent the spread of COVID-19 to our coworkers, friends and loved ones.

What evidence does the claim refer to in order to argue that the alleged concerns of the United States over Cuba's cooperation, in this case about the ‘More Doctors’ program, are neither legitimate nor pertinent to be discussed at PAHO?		
- Recognizes evidence that the Cuban regime’s deployment of Cuban doctors during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as through the Mais Médicos program in Brazil between 2013 and 2018, constitute human trafficking, and documents concerns by the UN Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery and the UN Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons.		

What are the alleged concerns of the United States over Cuba's cooperation in the ""More Doctors"" program, and how do these concerns relate to the issues of autonomy and fair wages for Cuban doctors on international missions?		
There is some suggestion, for example, that these doctors may not have autonomous decision-making regarding whether they want to deploy on these international missions, but rather are forced to do so by the government.24 Recent legal proceedings in Brazil, moreover, have sought to show that the Cuban model of exporting physicians for economic gain violates the International Labour Organization’s agreement on the protection of wages.24 This is based on the findings from the Mais Medicos programme that suggest that Cuban medics received significantly less in wages than their international counterparts, with the majority of the wages paid directly by Brazil to Cuba for its doctors being retained by the Cuban state.23 24		

What are the alleged concerns of the United States over Cuba's cooperation, in this case about the 'More Doctors' program, based on the evidence provided?		
Recent media coverage of the closure of the Mais Medicos programme20 in Brazil has focused on the political determinants of these overseas medical missions, where Cuban doctors are sent to provide healthcare in exchange for oil or hard currency.12 21 Political motivations have also been suggested as standing behind Cuba’s provision of over half of the medical professionals for Mission Barrio Adentro in Venezuela, Chavez’s (now failing) health and social welfare programmes focused on delivering universal healthcare across poorer neighbourhoods.22 Such activities have spurred discussion on the motivation for this Cuban international activity, whether driven by international prestige,14 goodwill, soft power,12 solidarity13 or economic gain.23 Cuba’s medical missions have also been criticised for violating the (labour) rights of those deployed.		

What are the alleged concerns of the United States over Cuba's cooperation in the ""More Doctors"" program, and how do they relate to the rights of Cuban health workers?		
Governments seeking support from Cuban health workers to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic should press Cuban authorities to modify applicable regulations and laws that violate the right to privacy, freedom of expression and association, liberty, and movement, among others.		

What are the alleged concerns of the United States over Cuba's cooperation in the 'More Doctors' program, and how do they relate to Cuba's achievements in global health security and infectious disease control?		
Cuba’s activities in global health security speak directly to these debates. Indeed, Cuba has made considerable strides in infectious disease control, comparable to that of high-income countries, doing so in a low-income setting beleaguered by a struggling economy, and facing resource and access challenges from the US embargo.		

What are the concerns of the United States over Cuba's cooperation in the 'More Doctors' program, and how do these concerns relate to the alleged human rights violations of Cuban doctors?		
“Cuban doctors deployed to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic provide valuable services to many communities, but at the expense of their most basic freedoms,” said José Miguel Vivanco, Americas director at Human Rights Watch.		

What are the challenges faced by the Cuban healthcare system, and how do they relate to the US embargo?		
Of course, the Cuban health-care system faces big challenges. ""The biggest challenge is lack of access to pharmaceuticals and technology, largely because of the U.S. embargo,"" says Diane Appelbaum, RN, who directs the Community Partnerships for Health Equity program at MEDICC (Medical Education Cooperation with Cuba), a nonprofit group that works to enhance cooperation among U.S., Cuban and global health professionals as a way to improve health and equity.		

What are the concerns of the United States over Cuba's cooperation in the 'More Doctors' program, and how do these concerns relate to the health outcomes and indicators in Cuba?		
These services have produced world-leading health outcomes and demonstrate what is possible to accomplish in a resource-poor setting, allowing Cuba to demonstrate a strong domestic health security position, although the veracity of some of these claims has been disputed.27 In particular, critiques have highlighted that the Cuban image of a high-performing system appears to be almost exclusively based on infant mortality rates—an explicit point of focus of Cuban government policy—at the cost of other health indicators, including maternal mortality, disability, disease exposure and life expectancy, and underinvestment in the social determinants of health more broadly.27 28		

What are the challenges that Cuba faces in terms of health security, and how do these challenges relate to the alleged concerns of the United States over Cuba's cooperation in the 'More Doctors' program?		
Health security in Cuba, however, also faces challenges. These concern Cuba’s visibility and participation in the broader global health security architecture, the social controls exercised by the state in managing disease threats in Cuban territory, and the resource constraints facing the island—in particular, the effects of the US embargo.

239,"Judith Collins, the National Party leader stated that New Zealand was using more coal to generate electricity because of the oil and gas exploration ban.","Did Judith Collins' claim that New Zealand is using more coal to generate electricity because of the oil and gas exploration ban relate to New Zealand or Australia?		
This investment is contributing to a changing energy mix in Australia. Over the past decade, the share of electricity generation from renewable sources has increased steadily to be nearly 20 per cent in 2018 (Graph 1).[1]		

What is Judith Collins' reason for the increase in coal use in New Zealand?		
Coal use is projected to decline until the 2030s as regions replace coal with natural gas and renewables		

What is Judith Collins' explanation for the decline in the share of clean energy sources in New Zealand's electricity supply?		
This has slowed the transition towards a clean electricity system. Despite the impressive growth of solar and wind power, the overall share of clean energy sources in total electricity supply in 2018, at 36%, was the same as it was 20 years earlier because of the decline in nuclear.		

Does Judith Collins' statement that the oil and gas exploration ban led to an increase in coal generation align with the expected long-term transition towards renewable energy in New Zealand?		
In the longer term, the transition towards renewable energy is expected to continue. Significant coal-fired generation capacity will be retired over coming decades and is likely to be replaced mainly by distributed energy resources and large-scale renewable energy generators, supported by energy storage.		

Is there a correlation between the oil and gas exploration ban and the use of coal for generating electricity in New Zealand?		
Renewable energy investment has increased significantly in Australia over recent years, contributing to a continuing shift in the energy generation mix away from traditional fossil fuel sources.		

Is the decline in New Zealand's share of global electricity supply due to the oil and gas exploration ban, as claimed by Judith Collins?		
However, its share of global electricity supply has been declining in recent years. That has been driven by advanced economies, where nuclear fleets are ageing, additions of new capacity have dwindled to a trickle, and some plants built in the 1970s and 1980s have been retired.		

Did Judith Collins claim that the oil and gas exploration ban led to an increase in coal-fired electricity generation in New Zealand?		
Although coal-fired generation more than doubles throughout the projection period, the share of electricity		

Is Judith Collins' claim that New Zealand is using more coal to generate electricity because of the oil and gas exploration ban supported by the evidence provided?

Is there any evidence that the format change for the presidential debate, which included a single moderator and town hall format, was related to Joe Biden receiving the questions in advance?		
That year’s vice presidential debate had a single moderator to pose questions. Based on feedback afterward, the commission decided to use only the single-moderator and town hall formats going forward.		

Who is responsible for providing the questions for the presidential debate?		
The Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) was established in 1987 to ensure, for the benefit of the American electorate, that general election debates between or among the leading candidates for the offices of President and Vice President of the United States are a permanent part of the electoral process.		

How did the presidential debates change over time, and what is the difference between the old format and the current one?		
Today’s televised debates don’t much resemble the first ones. From the first debates between John Kennedy and Richard Nixon in 1960 through the 1988 edition, the candidates answered questions posed by a panel of journalists, with the moderator there mainly to explain and enforce the ground rules (sometimes more effectively than others) and keep the proceedings moving.		

Who was responsible for organizing the presidential debate in which Joe Biden participated?		
The campaigns bickered constantly over who could or could not be a moderator or panelist. Finally, the League of Women Voters, which had organized the 1976, 1980 and 1984 debates, threw in the towel, leaving the job to the newly created debate commission.

There’s no evidence to suggest Biden is actually on any drugs, legal or otherwise. But purely hypothetically: Would Adderall really do what Giuliani (and by implication, Trump) claims?		

Did Dr. Marc Siegel suggest that President Joe Biden is using Adderall?		
The president’s ridiculous claims, which he’s used to demand that Biden take a drug test before the debates, were given an air of legitimacy Monday night by Fox News medical contributor Dr. Marc Siegel, who wildly speculated that the former vice president is using speed and Adderall.		

Is there evidence to support the claim that President Joe Biden is abusing the prescription drug Adderall, or is the claim unrelated to the evidence provided?		
The widespread use of prescription stimulants for ADHD has not been without critics. In recent months, we have heard speculation about whether ADHD is a real disease, and if it is real, whether it is being grossly over-diagnosed.		

What is the relationship between the shortage of ADHD drugs like Adderall and the claim that President Joe Biden is abusing the prescription drug Adderall?		
In fact, some students are faking ADHD to gain access to prescription stimulant medication, which has led to a shortage of ADHD drugs such as Adderall (Mitchell 2012).		

Is there any evidence that links President Joe Biden to the use of the prescription drug Adderall, or is the claim simply a continuation of unverified speculation about Trump's alleged drug use?		
There has long been unverified speculation that Trump uses drugs. This appears to have started during the 2016 presidential debates with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, when Trump's sniffing was linked to possible drug use.		

What is the growing trend of Adderall misuse and abuse, as described by the evidence, related to?

What is the prevalence of prescription stimulant misuse, including Adderall, among medical students?		
The prevalence of prescription stimulant misuse in medical students is also high. In fact, discussion based websites such as Facebook, Medical School Forum, and The Student Doctor Network are rife with Adderall “experts” and informal question-and-answer sessions on the drug.		

What is the trend of Adderall misuse over the past 15 to 20 years, and what age group is most affected by this trend?		
Adderall misuse has significantly increased over the past 15 to 20 years. A study published in The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry in 2016, found that Adderall abuse occurred primarily in young adults.

242,"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention downgrades COVID-19, rating it less fatal than seasonal flu","Does the evidence suggest that COVID-19 is less fatal than seasonal flu, as claimed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention?		
Based on the figure of approximately 60 000 COVID-19 deaths in the US as of the end of April 2020, this ratio suggests only a 1.0-fold to 2.6-fold change from the CDC-estimated seasonal influenza deaths calculated during the previous 7 full seasons.3 From our analysis, we infer that either the CDC’s annual estimates substantially overstate the actual number of deaths caused by influenza or that the current number of COVID-19 counted deaths substantially understates the actual number of deaths caused by SARS-CoV-2, or both.		

Does the CDC's rating of COVID-19 as less fatal than seasonal flu align with Dr. Fauci's statement that COVID-19 is at least 10 times more lethal than the seasonal flu?		
Fauci said COVID-19 is at least 10 times ""more lethal"" than the seasonal flu, even if the mortality rate drops far below the World Health Organization's current estimate of 3.4%.		

How does the number of provisionally reported COVID-19 deaths compare to influenza deaths during the peak week of the current season, according to the CDC?		
The CDC also publishes provisional counts of COVID-19 deaths but acknowledges that its reporting lags behind other public data sources.7 For the week ending April 11, 2020, data indicate that the number of provisionally reported COVID-19 deaths was 14.4-fold greater than influenza deaths during the apparent peak week of the current season (week ending February 29, 2020), consistent with the ranges based on CDC statistics.6 As the CDC continues to revise its COVID-19 counts to account for delays in reporting, the ratio of counted COVID-19 deaths to influenza deaths is likely to increase.		

Does the evidence suggest that the CDC downgraded COVID-19, rating it less fatal than seasonal flu?		
The adjusted mortality rate from coronavirus of 1% was then compared with the 0.1% mortality rate from seasonal influenza, and the conclusion was reported to the House Committee that the coronavirus was 10-times more lethal than seasonal influenza.		

What is the mortality rate of COVID-19 according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)?		
In a comparative analysis with WHO and CDC documents, the coronavirus mortality rate of 2-3% that was adjusted to 1% in Congressional testimony is consistent with the coronavirus CFR of 1.8-3.4% (median, 2.6%) reported by the CDC.13		

Does the World Health Organization's reported CFR of the 1918 H1N1 influenza virus (2-3%) support the claim that COVID-19 is less fatal than seasonal flu?		
Furthermore, the WHO reported that the CFR of the H1N1 influenza virus (1918) is also 2-3%,14 similar to the unadjusted 2-3% CFR of the coronavirus reported in Congressional testimony, with no meaningful difference in mortality.		

Does the CDC rate COVID-19 as more or less fatal than seasonal flu?		
- Fauci said the coronavirus is 10 times deadlier than the seasonal flu, which has a 0.1 percent mortality rate.		

How many flu deaths did the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate occurred in the current flu season?		
(During the current flu season, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that there have been 39 million to 56 million flu illnesses and 24,000 to 62,000 flu deaths in the U.S., although that number is an estimate based on hospitalizations with flu symptoms, not based on actually counting up every person who has died of flu.)		

Does the CDC's adjusted coronavirus mortality rate affect the comparison of COVID-19's fatality rate to that of seasonal flu?		
Had the adjusted coronavirus mortality rate not been lowered from 3% to 1%, fatality comparisons of the coronavirus to the IFR of seasonal influenza would have increased from 10-times higher to 20- to 30-times higher.		

Does the CDC rate COVID-19 as less fatal than the seasonal flu?		
The WHO's estimated mortality rate for COVID-19 started off at 2%, Fauci said. If you count all the estimated cases of people who may have it but haven't been diagnosed yet, the mortality rate is probably closer to 1%, he said, ""which means it's 10 times more lethal than the seasonal flu.""

There is no single food that will prevent you from catching COVID-19. For more information on a healthy diet, see the Healthy diet fact sheet.		

Is there any scientific evidence that eating millets or any other food can provide protection against COVID-19?		
According to EFSA, there is currently no evidence that COVID-19 is transmitted through eating food. However, good food safety practices are important to minimise the risk of foodborne illnesses.		

What is the relationship between a healthy diet and the prevention or treatment of COVID-19?		
Simply put, there are no foods that will ‘boost’ our immune system and prevent or treat COVID-19. However, eating a healthy balanced diet is still essential for good health and normal immune function.		

How does a healthy diet, including millets, support a strong immune system during the COVID-19 pandemic?		
Good nutrition is very important before during and after an infection. While no foods or dietary supplements can prevent COVID-19 infection, maintaining a healthy diet is an important part of supporting a strong immune system.

- Postelection audits: In 2018, a review of returned absentee ballot records helped identify anomalies in the election results of Bladen County, North Carolina, enabling election officials to uncover election interference by a political operative who stole and tampered with mail ballots.		

What are the anti-fraud protections built into the mail balloting process in the US, and how do they prevent potential voter fraud?		
According to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University, there is no evidence that mail balloting increases electoral fraud as there are several anti-fraud protections built into the process designed to make it difficult to impersonate voters or steal ballots.		

How does the rarity of voter fraud in the US, as supported by multiple studies and statistics, relate to the claim that mail-in ballots being sent to a man's deceased parents in Mercer County in New Jersey is a cause of potential voter fraud in the 2020 US Presidential Election?

How do the case fatality rates of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV compare to the chance of an asteroid hitting Earth on 02/11/2020?		
As comparisons, the table shows the case fatality rates for other disease outbreaks. The CFR of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were high: 10% and 34%, respectively.13		

Can the case fatality rate accurately compare the risk of dying from COVID-19 to the risk of an asteroid hitting Earth on 02/11/2020?		
In order to understand what the case fatality rate can and cannot tell us about a disease outbreak such as COVID-19, it’s important to understand why it is difficult to measure and interpret the numbers.		

What is the correct case fatality rate of COVID-19, and how does it compare to the risk of an asteroid hitting Earth on 02/11/2020?		
But 2.7% is often misreported as the case fatality rate – which is wrong, because not everyone in the world was infected with the virus that caused the Spanish flu.		

Is the claim that there is more chance of an asteroid hitting Earth on 02/11/2020 than dying from COVID-19 supported by the evidence provided?		
When the number of actual cases and deaths is not known – as is the case for COVID – one has to be careful in interpreting the CFR.		

How does the evidence provided relate to the claim that there is more chance of an asteroid hitting Earth on 02/11/2020 than dying from COVID-19?		
However, as we explain here, the total number of cases of COVID-19 is not known. One big reason for this is that not everyone with COVID-19 is tested.8,9		

What is the case fatality ratio for COVID-19 in China as of 20 February 2020, according to the World Health Organization (WHO)?

“Confirming a Supreme Court nominee during a presidential election year when the White House and Senate majority are of the same party is consistent with precedent.”		

What is the precedent regarding the nomination and installation of a Supreme Court justice when a presidential election is already underway?		
Yes. “When a vacancy occurs on the Supreme Court in an election year and the presidency and the Senate are controlled by the same party, the precedent has been for the president’s nominee to get a vote on confirmation.		

How many times has a Supreme Court vacancy occurred during a presidential election year in the history of the United States?		
“The circumstance of a Supreme Court vacancy in a presidential election year is not unusual. In our nation’s history, we’ve had little over two centuries of experience as the United States of America, that situation has occurred 29 times.

Is there a tradition of not nominating and installing a Supreme Court nominee during a presidential election year?		
There is no such tradition. The table shows the nine Supreme Court vacancies in place during election years in the Court’s post-Civil War era—once Congress stabilized the Court’s membership at nine and the justices largely stopped serving as trial judges in the old circuit courts.		

Has a Supreme Court nominee ever been nominated and installed while a presidential election is already underway?		
“Rarely does a Supreme Court vacancy occur in the final year of a presidential term … Given that we are in the midst of the presidential election process, we believe that the American people should seize the opportunity to weigh in.”		

Does the evidence support the claim that a Supreme Court nominee has never been nominated and installed while a presidential election is already underway?		
No. He is reported to have said, “There is 80 years of precedent for not nominating and confirming a new justice of the Supreme Court in the final year of a president’s term so that people can have a say in this very important decision.”		

What is the precedent regarding the nomination and installation of a Supreme Court nominee during a presidential election year?		
That was entirely the precedent.” When that anticipation became reality with the death of Justice Ginsburg, he offered a slightly different excuse: “Since the 1880s, no Senate has confirmed an opposite-party president’s Supreme Court nominee in a presidential election year”.

Our model suggests that Nigeria is not on track to meet the SDG target for U5MR (SDG 3.2.2) by 2030. At current national AARDs, it will achieve SDG 3.2.2 in 2052 (22 years behind schedule).		

What was the overall trend in Nigeria's progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) before the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the Sustainable Development Goals Report 2020?		
The Sustainable Development Goals Report 2020 brings together the latest data to show us that, before the COVID-19 pandemic, progress remained uneven and we were not on track to meet the Goals by 2030.		

How has Nigeria's progress towards the health-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) been tracked in the past five years, given its failure to meet its Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target on Under-five Mortality Rate (U5MR)?		
Given that Nigeria failed to meet its MDG target on U5MR, early tracking of its progress towards the health-related SDG targets is important—if the country is off track, this would highlight the need for intensified action to accelerate progress.		

Does Nigeria's progress in reducing the number of deaths per 1,000 live births (NMR) over the past five years align with the required average annual decrease of 9% needed to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target of 12 deaths per 1,000 live births by 2030?		
For Nigeria to achieve its SDG target for NMR of 12 deaths per 1,00 live births (SDG 3.2.1), its national NMR will have to decrease by 9% every year, on average, between 2018 and 2030.		

What are the areas where Nigeria has made progress in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) over the past five years?		
Five years since the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals, the 2020 Report notes that progress had been made in some areas, such as improving maternal and child health, expanding access to electricity and increasing women’s representation in government.		

What is the current status of Nigeria's achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) targets?

What is the required average annual decrease in neonatal mortality rate (NMR) for some Nigerian states to meet the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3.2.1 target?		
However, the AARD required to reach SDG 3.2.1 at the state level varies widely. While Kwara state has already achieved the SDG 3.2.1 target, some other states such as Zamfara and Kano will need to achieve an average annual decrease in NMR of 11%, and 13% respectively, in order to meet the NMR SDG targets.		

How does Nigeria's performance on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) targets, such as NMR (SDG 3.2.1) and U5MR (SDG 3.2.2), impact its overall performance in achieving the SDGs?		
As Nigeria moves towards achieving its child survival targets, it will be critical for policymakers at the state-level to track their performance on both SDG targets for NMR (SDG 3.2.1) and U5MR (SDG 3.2.2), measure their performance against the policies they introduce, and continuously assess what is possible by comparing their performance with high performing states.		

What is the expected reduction in neonatal and under-five deaths in Nigeria if each state achieves and maintains the required Average Annual Rate of Decline (AARD) to meet its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) targets for neonatal mortality rate (NMR) and under-five mortality rate (U5MR)?

How many black federal judges has Donald Trump appointed among the nearly one quarter of all active federal judges he has appointed in the United States?		
Trump has appointed nearly one quarter of all active federal judges in the United States, according to Pew Research Center, and has appointed more federal appeals court judges than any president at this point in his presidency since Jimmy Carter.

How many of Trump's federal judges are minorities, and what is the demographic breakdown of his judicial appointees?		
As a Republican president, it is not at all unexpected that Trump has used the nominations process to appoint conservative judges to the bench.50 What is worrisome, especially given the recent trend even among Republican presidents towards increasing diversity on the federal bench, is that Trump’s judicial appointees have been woefully lacking in diversity.51 Although snapshots of the demographic profile of the federal judges appointed by Trump vary slightly depending on the timing, an independent analysis of Trump’s judicial appointees from demographic data compiled by the Federal Judicial Center suggests that of the eighty-three judges confirmed in Trump’s first two years in office, only seven are minorities and twenty are women (including two women of color), making his appointees 92 percent white and 76 percent male.52

According to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University, there is no evidence that mail balloting increases electoral fraud as there are several anti-fraud protections built into the process designed to make it difficult to impersonate voters or steal ballots.		

Is there evidence that mail-in ballots increase electoral fraud in the US presidential election?		
There is no evidence that mail ballots increase electoral fraud. Several anti-fraud protections are built into the process.		

Can a single instance of a mail-in ballot application being sent to a deceased individual, such as a grandfather in New Mexico, be considered evidence of widespread voter fraud via mail-in ballots, given the presence of built-in safeguards in the mail-in voting process that make it difficult for one person to vote fraudulently or commit voter fraud on a large scale?		
The mail-in voting process has several built-in safeguards that together make it hard for one person to vote fraudulently, and even more difficult to commit voter fraud on a scale capable of swinging election outcomes.		

How does the rarity of voter fraud, whether in-person or by mail, relate to the claim that a mail-in ballot application sent to a deceased grandfather in New Mexico is evidence of potential widespread voter fraud via mail-in ballots?		
Voter fraud is very rare, whether people vote in person or by mail. That much is clear from a large body of research.		

Is the claim that a mail-in ballot application sent to a deceased grandfather in New Mexico is evidence of potential widespread voter fraud via mail-in ballots supported by the evidence, which suggests that reporting suspicious activity, including illegal filling out of mail-in ballots, is encouraged by authorities?

How does the signature matching process prevent fraudulent mail-in ballots from being counted in the US presidential election?		
If someone falsely casts a deceased voter’s ballot, for instance, it would be removed because the signature wouldn’t pass a signature matching review against the signature on file.		

How do the safeguards implemented by election officials, such as identity and signature verification, bar codes, ballot tracking, and post-election audits, address concerns about potential voter fraud in the mail-in voting process?		
Election officials have implemented a number of safeguards to protect the mail-in voting process. These include identity and signature verification, bar codes on ballot envelopes that allow voters to know whether their ballot has been received, ballot tracking through the U.S. Postal Service, and post-election audits, among other measures.		

What is the relationship between the reported incident of a mail-in ballot application being sent to a deceased individual in New Mexico and the conclusion that incidents of mail-in ballot fraud are rare, as stated in a 2020 report from the University of New Mexico's Center for Social Policy, the UCLA Voting Rights Project, and the Union of Concerned Scientists?		
A 2020 report from the University of New Mexico's Center for Social Policy, the UCLA Voting Rights Project, and the Union of Concerned Scientists concluded that incidents of mail-in ballot fraud are rare, including in states that have adopted universal vote-by-mail systems.		

How does the state of New Mexico's system for verifying signatures on mail-in ballots prevent potential fraud, and what measures are in place to detect and address any discrepancies?		
The state has even built a system to catch potential fraud of the sort Trump alleges — directly contacting voters if their ballot signature doesn't match the voter registration signature and asking them to update it in their files if their signature has changed, for instance.		

What measures are proposed to prevent and address potential mail-in ballot fraud, and how do these measures address the issue of mail-in ballot applications being sent to deceased individuals?		
Hancock’s bill would widen the definition of mail-in ballot fraud, boost penalties for certain offenses, strengthen rules for signature verification and require election judges to notify voters when ballots are rejected.

267,Pennsylvania ballots will be rejected without outer and inner envelopes.,"What are the specific requirements for submitting a mail-in ballot in Pennsylvania, and what are the consequences if these requirements are not met?		
Under Pennsylvania’s mail voting statute, voters are supposed to place their completed ballots inside the smaller secrecy envelope, then put that inside the postmarked envelope that comes with their ballot.		

What are the potential consequences for voters in Pennsylvania if they fail to include both the outer and inner envelopes with their mail-in ballots?		
It’s difficult to know how many ballots could be rejected due to missing secrecy envelopes, both because Pennsylvania drastically expanded mail voting for this year’s election, and because missing envelopes weren’t closely tracked in the past.		

What is the requirement for a ballot to be counted in Pennsylvania, according to a recent state court ruling?		
A recent state court ruling says Pennsylvania can’t count ballots mailed without a secrecy envelope. The decision makes the state an outlier nationally.		

What is the importance of using both outer and inner envelopes when returning a ballot in Pennsylvania, according to the instructions provided?		
Follow the instructions sent with your ballot to mark and return your ballot. Pay special attention to whether or not your state requires the use of a secrecy envelope for your voted ballot.		

What is the requirement for a ballot to be counted in Pennsylvania, according to the instructions provided with the ballot?		
(2) Upon receipt of the ballot the elector shall mark the ballot, place it in the secrecy envelope, sign the return mailing envelope supplied with the ballot, and comply with the instructions provided with the ballot.		

What information must be included in the outer return envelope for a mail-in ballot to be counted in Pennsylvania?		
- If the return ballot envelope does not contain the voter's name or other required information but does contain information identifying the person as eligible to vote (such as a voter identification number), the ballot should be counted.		

What is the purpose of the outer and inner envelopes in the mail-in voting process in Pennsylvania, and what happens if a ballot is not enclosed in both envelopes?		
3. When ballots are ready to be tabulated, the outer return envelope, which identifies the voter, will be separated from the voted ballot contained inside.		

What is the requirement for a ballot to be counted in Pennsylvania, according to the official guidance on voting?		
2. Upon receipt of the ballot, the voter shall mark it, place and seal the marked ballot in the secrecy envelope supplied with the ballot, place and seal the sealed secrecy envelope containing the marked ballot in the return identification envelope supplied with the ballot which has been signed by the voter and then return the marked ballot to the election authority by either:		

What is the importance of having both outer and inner envelopes in a Pennsylvania mail ballot package, according to the evidence?		
- Check the mail ballot packages carefully after they are prepared to make sure that all necessary items are enclosed, the envelopes are properly addressed, and that any assigned voter identification number on the return ballot envelope in each member's ballot package matches the number assigned to that member on the voter eligibility list.		

What is the consequence if a Pennsylvania ballot is not placed in both the outer and inner envelopes?		
- Place your ballot in the white inner secrecy envelope labeled “official ballot.” Note: Your ballot will not be counted if it is not in the secrecy envelope.

268,"US President Donald Trump's executive order on September 24, 2020 legally ensures health coverage protections for those with pre existing medical conditions.","How does the executive order signed by President Donald Trump on September 24, 2020, intend to ensure health coverage protections for those with pre-existing medical conditions, and what measures will be taken to enforce compliance with this policy?		
President Donald Trump signed an executive order today that declares it a national policy to protect patients with preexisting conditions regardless of the fate of the Affordable Care Act (ACA)—but just how they'll force insurers to comply remains unclear.		

What specific measures did President Trump's executive order on September 24, 2020 take to legally ensure health coverage protections for those with pre-existing medical conditions?		
But the executive order appears to fall short of that goal. The order states that protecting pre-existing conditions was ""the policy of the United States"" but did not provide any legislative guarantees that Americans would not lose such protections if the ACA were nixed by the Supreme Court.		

What does the executive order issued by President Trump on September 24, 2020, specifically state regarding health coverage protections for individuals with pre-existing medical conditions?		
President Trump has vowed to protect people with pre-existing conditions if the ACA is overturned and recently issued an executive order saying it is the “policy of the United States” to “ensure that Americans with pre-existing conditions can obtain the insurance of their choice at affordable rates.”		

What does the executive order state regarding health coverage protections for those with pre-existing medical conditions?		
- President Trump issued an executive order stating that it is U.S. policy to provide protection to Americans with pre-existing conditions, regardless of whether or not the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional.		

Does President Donald Trump's executive order on September 24, 2020 legally ensure health coverage protections for those with pre-existing medical conditions?		
President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Sept. 24 aimed at ensuring access to health insurance coverage for consumers with preexisting conditions, expanding hospital price transparency, and limiting surprise billing.		

Does President Trump's executive order on September 24, 2020 contradict his previous record of supporting legislation that would have weakened pre-existing condition protections and expanding short-term insurance plans that do not cover pre-existing conditions?		
President Trump’s record includes support for legislation to repeal and replace the ACA that would have weakened pre-existing condition protections, and expansion of short-term insurance plans that are not required to cover pre-existing conditions.		

Does the executive order issued by President Trump on September 24, 2020, have any legal effect on health coverage protections for individuals with pre-existing medical conditions?		
Trump has repeatedly promised an executive order to protect pre-existing condition coverage, but no text has been issued, and the ACA already does so.		

Does the executive order signed by President Trump on September 24, 2020, legally ensure health coverage protections for those with pre-existing medical conditions, as claimed by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar?		
Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told reporters on a conference call that one of the orders would declare it the policy of the United States to ""provide protections to ensure that Americans with preexisting conditions are protected regardless of whether the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional and its protections for preexisting conditions invalidated.""		

Does the executive order declare it the policy of the U.S. government to protect people with preexisting conditions, even if the Affordable Care Act is declared unconstitutional?		
Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said Trump’s executive order would declare it the policy of the U.S. government to protect people with preexisting conditions, even if the ACA is declared unconstitutional.		

What specific insurance practices, outlawed by the Affordable Care Act, would need to be reinstated for President Trump's executive order to legally ensure health coverage protections for those with pre-existing medical conditions?		
Providing comprehensive protections to people with pre-existing conditions, as the ACA does, requires outlawing a variety of insurance practices that were common before the law took full effect in 2014, including:

280,False positives and rapid tests put the rate of infection near zero and that there will be no second wave of infections,"How does the likelihood of false-positive results affect the accuracy of infection rates, particularly during periods of low influenza prevalence in the population?		
- False-positive results are more likely to occur when influenza prevalence in the population tested (e.g. community) is low, which is generally at the beginning and end of the influenza season and during the summer.		

Does the sensitivity of rapid tests (RIDT) affect the accuracy of the reported rate of infection, and could this impact the likelihood of a second wave of infections?		
However, negative RIDT results do not exclude influenza virus infection as a cause of a respiratory outbreak because of the limited sensitivity of these tests.		

Can false positive results from rapid tests lead to an overestimation of the rate of COVID-19 infection, potentially suggesting that the rate of infection is near zero when it may not be the case?		
Incorrect diagnosis of COVID-19 when it is not present (a false positive result) may lead to unnecessary further testing, treatment, and isolation of the person and close contacts.		

Can the results of rapid tests be trusted to accurately determine the rate of infection, or are there limitations that could lead to false negatives and overestimation of the rate of infection?		
However, due to the limited sensitivities, negative results of RIDTs do not exclude influenza virus infection in patients with signs and symptoms suggestive of influenza.		

Can a patient's positive result from a rapid influenza diagnostic test (RIDT) be due to a false positive result, especially when the community prevalence of influenza is low?		
- A patient tests positive by RIDT and the community prevalence of influenza is low, and a false positive result is a consideration.		

How does the accuracy of antibody tests for detecting COVID-19 vary between patients with severe symptoms and those with mild or moderate symptoms?		
The accuracy of antibody tests for detecting COVID-19 in these patients may be different from the accuracy of the tests in people with mild or moderate symptoms.		

How does the presence of clinical signs and symptoms of influenza affect the reliability of a positive rapid influenza diagnostic test (RIDT) result?		
- Having clinical signs and symptoms consistent with influenza increases the pre-test probability of influenza virus infection, which increases the reliability of a positive RIDT result.		

Does the timing of antibody tests play a crucial role in accurately detecting COVID-19 infections, potentially affecting the reported rate of infection and the likelihood of a second wave of infections?		
The review shows that antibody tests could have a useful role in detecting if someone has had COVID-19, but the timing of test use is important.		

Can the accuracy of rapid tests and antibody tests in detecting SARS-CoV-2 virus be relied upon to accurately determine the rate of infection and predict the likelihood of a second wave of infections?		
Some antibody tests could be a useful diagnostic tool for those in whom molecular- or antigen-based tests have failed to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus, including in those with ongoing symptoms of acute infection (from week three onwards) or those presenting with post-acute sequelae of COVID-19.		

How does the evidence suggest that testing respiratory specimens can impact the detection of influenza virus infection?		
Testing respiratory specimens from several persons with suspected influenza will increase the likelihood of detecting influenza virus infection if influenza virus is the cause of the outbreak, and use of molecular assays such as RT-PCR is recommended if the cause of the outbreak is not determined and influenza is suspected.

284,Former US vice-president Joe Biden is showing pretty severe signs of dementia.,"What is Joe Biden's lifelong struggle that he has been open about?		
Former Vice President Joe Biden opened up about his lifelong struggle with stuttering on Wednesday, offering a rare lengthy and personal reflection on how it has affected him, even to this day.		

Is Joe Biden's occasional forgetfulness or loss of train of thought evidence of dementia?		
The headlines after the event? “Biden Forgets Obama’s Name.” Other times when Biden fudges a detail or loses his train of thought, it seems unrelated to stuttering, like he’s just making a mistake.		

How do doctors diagnose dementia, according to the evidence provided?		
There is no one test to determine if someone has dementia. Doctors diagnose Alzheimer's and other types of dementia based on a careful medical history, a physical examination, laboratory tests, and the characteristic changes in thinking, day-to-day function and behavior associated with each type.		

Is the evidence provided suggesting that Joe Biden has been diagnosed with dementia or showing signs of mental decline?		
Alpern told me that she’s on a group text with other stutterers who regularly discuss Biden, and that it’s been “frustrating” to watch the media portray Biden’s speech impediment as a sign of mental decline or dishonesty.		

What does the author of the article suggest might be the reason behind Joe Biden's campaign agreeing to an interview with someone who stutters?		
Listening back to that part of the conversation after our interview made me feel dizzy. I can only speculate as to why Biden’s campaign agreed to this interview, but I assume the reasoning went something like this: If Biden disclosed to me, a person who stutters, that he himself still actively stutters, perhaps voters would cut him some slack when it comes to verbal misfires, as well as errors that seem more related to memory and cognition.		

What is the process of diagnosing dementia, and how does it relate to the claim that Joe Biden is showing severe signs of dementia?		
There is no one test to diagnose dementia. Instead, the diagnosis involves a range of assessments and examinations, which can mean that confirming a diagnosis can take time, particularly in the early stages.		

Does the evidence suggest that Joe Biden is showing signs of dementia?		
Some of his answers that night had been meandering and difficult to parse, feeding into the narrative that he wasn’t just prone to verbal slipups—he’s called himself a “gaffe machine”—but that his age was a problem, that he was confused and out of touch.		

What are the signs of cognitive decline that could suggest dementia, as mentioned in the evidence, and how do they relate to the claim about Joe Biden's cognitive abilities?		
For example, in highly educated and highly functioning individuals, a compelling history of cognitive decline (eg, no longer able to perform a complex task that could easily be done a year ago, such as filling out a tax return or working at a cognitively demanding job such as physician or lawyer) can suggest dementia despite “normal” function on a brief, screening cognitive test.		

What is the evidence suggesting about the process of diagnosing dementia, and how does it relate to the claim that Joe Biden is showing severe signs of dementia?		
Obtaining a diagnosis of dementia can be a difficult, lengthy and intensive process. While circumstances differ from person to person, Dementia Australia believes that everyone has the right to:		

Does the evidence provided suggest that Joe Biden has been diagnosed with dementia?

Based on our research, viral claims about SB-145 as ""pro-pedophilia"" legislation are FALSE. From its passage and vote count to its contents, posts online have spread falsehoods about the legislation, which allows judges to have the same level of discretion over sex offender registration for anal and oral sex that they already do for penile-vaginal sex.

A ""yes"" vote supported classifying certain crimes as misdemeanors instead of felonies unless the defendant had prior convictions for murder, rape, certain sex offenses or certain gun crimes; allowing resentencing for those currently serving a prison sentence for any of the offenses that the initiative reduced to misdemeanors; and creating the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Fund to receive appropriations based on savings from the initiative.		

What were the goals and outcomes of the sentencing reforms implemented by California Governor Gavin Newsom, as described by the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice?		
The Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice, a nonprofit based in San Francisco, described AB 109 and Propositions 47 and 57 as successful sentencing reforms that reduced overcrowding in state prisons.[13]

During a hearing in July 1993 on Ginsburg's nomination to the Supreme Court, Susan Hirschmann, executive director of Eagle Forum, interpreted Ginsburg's recommendations from a report co-authored by Ginsburg as ""the age of consent for sexual acts must be lowered to 12 years old.""		

Did Ginsburg's argument in ""Sex Bias in the U.S. Code"" aim to change the age of consent for sex, or was it focused on removing gender-based language and assumptions in the Mann Act?		
Ginsburg's argument in ""Sex Bias in the U.S. Code"" focused on removing language and assumptions that a sexual assault victim would always be a woman, not on changing the age of consent.		

Does the evidence suggest that Ruth Bader Ginsburg advocated for a specific change to the age of consent for sex, and if so, what was the proposed change?		
""Ginsburg and her co-author argue that the law should be rewritten to outlaw sexual abuse of any minor, male or female, by any person who is significantly older, male or female,"" Slate said.

We rate this claim as FALSE, based on our research. Ginsburg's reports from the 1970s were advocating for more gender-neutral language in.federal law, not to lower the age of consent.		

Is there any evidence to support the claim that Ruth Bader Ginsburg waged an ""active campaign"" to repeal the Mann Act and lower the age of consent for sex, or is this claim based on a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of her views?		
Susan Hirschmann, executive director of the conservative Eagle Forum, then said that among Ginsburg’s ""extremist feminist concepts"" was the belief that ""the age of consent for sexual acts must be lowered to 12 years old.""		

What was Ruth Bader Ginsburg's stance on sex classifications and gender equality in her early career as a lawyer?		
The same year as Roe, Ginsburg argued her first case before the Supreme Court, Frontiero v. Richardson, wherein she advocated that strict scrutiny be applied to sex classifications just as it was to racial classifications.		

What was Ruth Bader Ginsburg's approach to addressing sex discrimination in the law, as reflected in her work on cases such as the Mann Act?		
Sex discrimination, in other words, was unconstitutional. Susan Deller Ross, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center, who also worked as a lawyer on sex-discrimination cases during this period, said of Ginsburg, “She helped turn the Court a hundred and eighty degrees, from a very hands-off attitude, which had often been expressed very cavalierly, to one where they struck down law after law that treated the sexes differently.”		

What specific issue did Ruth Bader Ginsburg focus on in her work with the ACLU, and was it related to the age of consent for sex?		
Ginsburg’s experiences with sex discrimination inspired her to lead the ACLU’s campaign for gender equality, but she was not the first person to see the need for the ACLU to dedicate its efforts to women’s rights.		

Did Ruth Bader Ginsburg ever propose or advocate for lowering the age of consent for sexual acts to 12 years old, as claimed in the evidence?		
Jipping argued that Ginsburg's recommendations were ""drafting women, and sending them into combat. Legalizing prostitution, which she believes is protected by the Constitution,"" and ""lowering the age of consent for sexual acts to 12 years,"" according to The Congressional Record.		

Is there any evidence to suggest that Ruth Bader Ginsburg actually advocated for the repeal of the Mann Act and the lowering of the age of consent to 12 years old, or was the quote taken out of context or misattributed to her?		
""The age of consent for sexual acts must be lowered to age 12 years old,"" reads the quote attributed to ""Ruth Traitor Ginsburg"" in 1977.

297,Flu shot is 2.4x more deadly than Covid-19.,"What is the relationship between the flu vaccine and the risk of in-hospital deaths, ICU admission, length of ICU stay, and hospital length of stay in patients 65 years or older, according to the evidence provided?		
In an analysis of the 2013-2014 influenza season (the most recent for which data are available), vaccination reduced the odds of in-hospital deaths (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.39; 95% CI, 0.17-0.66), ICU admission (aOR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.48-0.81), length of ICU stay (adjusted relative hazard [aRH], 1.34; 95% CI, 1.06-1.73), and hospital length of stay (aRH, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.13-1.37) in patients 65 years or older.19 Becoming infected with influenza does not prevent a person from becoming infected the next year, or even in the same season; again, this is due to genetic drift or infection with an unrelated influenza virus.		

What is the estimated number of deaths caused by the flu in the United States, and how does it compare to the number of deaths attributed to COVID-19?		
These ranges can be quite large, depending on the flu season. Since 2010, there have been 9.2 million to 35.6 million cases of influenza in the United States, causing an estimated 140,000 to 710,000 hospitalizations and 12,000 to 56,000 deaths in each.1 The total economic burden of annual influenza epidemics using projected statistical life-values is nearly $100		

What is the effectiveness of the flu vaccine in preventing hospitalizations for pneumonia and influenza?		
Recent studies have produced varied results regarding vaccine effectiveness. Baxter et al found that over 11 influenza seasons, vaccination prevented 8.5% of hospitalizations for pneumonia and influenza in those 65 years and older, and 12.4% in those 50 to 64 years.12 Talbot et al reported that influenza vaccination prevented 61% of respiratory hospitalizations in community-dwelling older adults 50 years and older.13		

What is the effectiveness of the flu vaccine over the past decade, and how does it relate to the claim that the flu shot is 2.4x more deadly than Covid-19?		
Over the past decade, the overall vaccine effectiveness has hovered in the 40% to 55% range, although some years have been better or worse than others (Figure 4).1 For instance, the 2014-2015 season was particularly bad, with vaccine effectiveness of less than 20%.		

How does the CDC's estimation of influenza's impact on the US population, including reported death rates, vaccination rates, and vaccine effectiveness, relate to the claim that the flu shot is 2.4x more deadly than Covid-19?		
Each year, the CDC estimates the impact of influenza on the US population, based on models that incorporate reported death rates (influenza and influenza-related), vaccination rates, and vaccine effectiveness, to arrive at ranges of persons affected, persons hospitalized, deaths, and illness averted.		

What is the relationship between the flu shot and the risk of illness or death, according to the provided evidence?		
Results of a single study involving 8963 adults (mean age, 62.5 years) during the 2014-2015 influenza season showed that the recombinant vaccine (RIV4) was more efficacious than the quadrivalent, inactivated virus vaccine (IIV4), and that people receiving it were 30% less likely to become ill with laboratory-confirmed influenza.42,43		

What does the evidence suggest about the safety and effectiveness of flu shots for people aged 65 years and older?		
Adults aged 65 years and older are at greater risk for hospitalization and death from seasonal influenza and respond to vaccination with lower antibody titers to influenza hemagglutinin compared with younger adults.10 A 2010 Cochrane Review concluded that available evidence provides no guidance regarding the safety or effectiveness of influenza vaccines for people aged 65 years and older.11		

How does the evidence suggest that children are affected by the flu, and what does this have to do with the claim that the flu shot is 2.4x more deadly than Covid-19?		
For children, the risk for hospitalization for severe complications from influenza is highest among those aged less than 2 years, and medical care and emergency department visits attributable to influenza are increased among children aged less than 5 years.5 Nearly half of the children who died from influenza virus infections during the 2010-2011 influenza season had no known ACIP-defined high-risk medical condition and were aged less than 5 years.6 Children aged 6 months through 8 years require two doses of influenza vaccine administered at least 4 weeks apart during their first season of vaccination to optimize response.		

How does the effectiveness of the flu vaccine change over time, and what implications does this have for the claim that the flu shot is 2.4x more deadly than Covid-19?		
A recent examination of vaccine effectiveness among enrollees (all ages) in the US Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network for the 2011-2012 through 2014-2015 influenza seasons supports the notion that effectiveness wanes with time.20		

How does the effectiveness of the flu vaccine in adults 50 years or older compare to the mortality rate of COVID-19, which is not 2.4x more deadly than the flu shot?		
To date, data from adequately powered trials have shown vaccine effectiveness of 40% to 60% in adults 50 years or older when circulating and influenza vaccine strains are similar.26 However, adequately powered trial data are lacking for the cohort of adults 65 years or older.

In August 2020, amid an ongoing political crisis in the U.S. surrounding the Postal Service and mail-in ballots, readers asked Snopes to examine widespread claims that by texting ""USPS"" to the number 50409, an individual could send a letter to their local political representatives expressing support for the Postal Service.		

What will texting RBG to 50409 result in, and what information will be required from the user to complete the action?		
Claims that ""Resistbot"" allowed users to quickly send letters to their political representatives were true, although it should be noted that the user is, for obvious reasons, required to actively provide a valid name, mailing address, and email address, and the letter is sent to federal representatives only, not state legislators.

Your friends, family, and followers can deliver that to their officials by texting sign followed by your unique code to 50409 or Resistbot on any platform.		

Is there any evidence that texting or sending a message to a senator is an effective way to contact them?		
Sending a text message to reach your Senator or Representative may sound less impactful than making a phone call or stopping by their office in person, but Putorti said faxes and emails ""are considered just as effective or more so [than phone calls] because there's no way to truly verify if a call is from a constituent.""		

What information do you need to provide to use the Resistbot service to sign a petition?		
You have to share some personal information with Resistbot to use it most effectively. When you first text “resist” to 50409, the bot asks for your full name and zip code, and it sends your first message to both of your senators.

At least 50 such incidents have been reported around the country since 24 May. Reports that police not only tolerate the presence of certain armed individuals at demonstrations (Washington Post, 30 August 2020; Huffington Post, 28 August 2020), but in some cases actively encourage their involvement suggest this trend will continue, amplifying the risk of violence.		

Was the man who died in police custody during the 19th September 2020 anti-lockdown protest in London subjected to similar treatment as the elderly protester in Buffalo, New York, who was violently pushed to the ground by police?		
At the start of June, for example, while some police officers kneeled with demonstrators in Buffalo, New York, separate reports surfaced showing the city’s police violently pushing an elderly protester to the ground, fracturing his skull, the next day (ABC, 6 June 2020; NPR, 30 June 2020).

Did the man who died in police custody after the 19th September 2020 anti-lockdown protest in London die as a result of an action taken by ANTIFA, as claimed by President Trump?		
President Trump tweeted a message of condolences for the deceased, alleging that he had been “murdered in Portland by ANTIFA” (Insider, 31 August 2020), despite the fact that it remains unclear who is responsible for the shooting.11Since initial publication, the suspect has been identified as Michael Reinoehl, who stated in an interview that he “was not a ‘member’ of antifa, but supported the ideology” (Washington Post, 4 September 2020).		

When did the alleged murder of the man in police custody occur, according to the evidence?		
Although his body has not been found, police believe he was murdered on or around 16 September 2008. Investigations revealed a possible link with the dealing of anabolic steroids.[371]		

Was the investigation into the man's death in police custody scaled back in June 2020?		
In June 2020, police announced that they were scaling back the investigation.[591]		

What is the date of the anti-lockdown protest in London that allegedly resulted in a man's death in police custody?		
These disinformation campaigns may be contributing to the decline in public support for the BLM movement after the initial increase following Floyd’s killing, especially amongst the white population (USA Today, 31 August 2020; Civiqs, 30 August 2020a, 30 August 2020b).

The Lost Cosmonaut rumors have been persuasively debunked as far back as the mid-1960s. It is now known that the Soviets did cover up disasters and accidents within the space program, but there is no evidence to suggest they ever covered up any deaths in orbit.		

How did the ""Lost Cosmonaut Conspiracy"" affect the reporting of the death of cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov in 1967?		
So potent was the Lost Cosmonaut Conspiracy that it impacted on the reporting of genuine Soviet space disasters such as the death of cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov when his Soyuz 1 spacecraft’s parachute malfunctioned during reentry in 1967, and the deaths of the Soyuz 11 crew in 1971 during another reentry accident.

Does the photo provided show the remains of Vladimir Komarov, a man who fell from space in 1967?

Is the claim that Amelia Bassano wrote all of William Shakespeare's plays a widely accepted theory within the world of Shakespearean authorship controversies?

In 1979, British historian A.L. Rowse advanced the then controversial theory that Amelia Bassano, with her Mediterranean skin coloring, was the famous “dark lady” of the Shakespeare sonnets, arguing that the woman’s physical characteristics, musical talent, tyrannical and temperamental character, age, marital status, and promiscuous nature—all described in the sonnets—match the known facts about Bassano more closely than those of any other woman of her time and place.

Amelia Bassano may have been dark-complected, however. A 2009 paper published in the Oxfordian, the journal of Shakespearean authorship studies, stated that some of Bassano's relatives were referred to as ""black"" when they arrived in London, likely due to their dark complexions:

Does the book provide evidence that Amelia Bassano was in a position to have written William Shakespeare's plays?

Does the evidence provided conclusively prove that COVID-19 was not man-made, or does it only address the origin of the virus, leaving the possibility of a lab escape still open?

We found 1,173 fewer polling places in 2018 — despite a significant increase in voter turnout. To understand the discriminatory impact of these closures, we analyzed how voters of color were impacted at the precinct level.		

How do election administrators determine the number of polling places and resources needed for an election, and what factors do they consider in this process?		
Leading researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) developed a resource allocation calculator to help election administrators across the country determine how many polling places, workers, or voting machines a jurisdiction needs based on a variety of factors, including the number of registered or eligible voters within a particular area.181 Additionally, in order to prevent problems in future elections, officials should conduct assessments of Election Day readiness after each election to evaluate issues such as wait times, difficulties during voter check-in, and bottlenecks in the voting process.		

Does the evidence suggest that reducing the number of polling places is a recommended strategy for states adopting early voting?		
When adopting early voting, states should avoid reducing the number of Election Day polling places, as doing so may result in long lines and may nullify some of early voting’s benefits.139 Relatedly, states must ensure sufficient polling place hours in order to allow people opportunities to vote.140 Today, most states require voting locations to be open for at least 12 hours.

In addition to increasing participation, the majority of election officials in jurisdictions with SDR have found implementation costs to be minimal, and roughly half of respondents said that it reduced the burden of voter registration surges that occur before traditional registration deadlines.91		

Are Ventura County election officials part of a broader trend of counties across the country eliminating polling places?		
Counties across the country continue to eliminate polling places. Just last month, Indiana Secretary of State Connie Lawson, a Republican, removed 170, mostly Democratic voting precincts from Lake County — home to the state’s largest Latino and second-largest black communities.		

How do the reduced voting locations in Ventura County potentially affect the voting experience and accessibility for certain groups of voters, such as voters of color?		
Our hope is that journalists, advocates, and voters will use this county-level polling place data to scrutinize the impact of poll closures in their communities, to understand their impact on voters of color, and to create a fairer and more just electoral system for all.		

Is the reduction of polling places in Ventura County election officials a part of a broader trend of reducing voting locations in formerly covered Section 5 jurisdictions between the 2014 and 2018 midterm elections?

Any social media post that claimed ""the NFL will honor and praise the organization that stood out outside [the] hospital chanting"" was at best a misleading attempting to connect dots that didn't exist.		

What did the NFL do in response to the incident where a 6-year-old boy begged God to save his mother's life after she was ambushed?		
Based on our analysis of videos of the shooting and protests, as well as first-person accounts and news reports, these assertions were a blend of fact and distortions of reality — presented in memes such as the one displayed below that aimed to dissuade people against supporting the NFL because of its alleged support for protesters who gathered outside the hospital:		

Is there any connection between the organization that yelled ""hope they die"" outside the mother's hospital and the Black Lives Matter movement?

341,Muslim regiment of the Indian Army had refused to fight in India’s 1965 war with Pakistan.,"Did the Indian Army have a Muslim regiment that existed until 1965, and if so, did it refuse to fight in India's 1965 war with Pakistan?		
The essence of the Pakistani disinformation is that a Muslim Regiment existed in the Indian Army till 1965, but was disbanded because in that conflict 20,000 Muslims refused to fight Pakistan.		

What is the evidence suggesting about the Muslim regiment of the Indian Army's participation in India's 1965 war with Pakistan?		
Such were the legends of Muslim warriors in 1965. The same followed in 1971. In later years Muslim bravehearts of the Indian army proved their mettle in Kargil and in fighting terror groups in J&K. Three army commanders, three corps commanders and a number of two star generals make up the community’s share of achievements in higher ranks.		

What is the claimant's basis for stating that the Muslim regiment of the Indian Army refused to fight in India's 1965 war with Pakistan, given that the evidence provided suggests that there was no Muslim Regiment in the Indian Army in 1965?		
Thereafter not a single Muslim participated in the 1971 conflict (another lie). Secondly, the percentage of Muslim servicemen as per the article is drastically below the ratio of Muslim population in India.		

What is the evidence suggesting about the military regiment of the Indian Army during the 1965 war with Pakistan?		
After Independence and the ensuing Partition of India, he opted to join the Indian Army and was a commissioned officer in the Punjab Regiment during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947.[7]		

What is the relationship between the 1965 Indo-Pakistani War and the division of the Indian Punjab region into three states?		
In 1966, after a victory for India in the 1965 Indo-Pakistani War, due in good part to the support of Sikhs, however, the Indian Punjab region was divided into three states—Punjab, Haryana, and Himachel Pradesh—and a Punjabi-majority state was created.		

What proportion of Muslim officers and soldiers remained in the Indian Army after Independence, and how did this affect the composition of the Indian Muslim servicemen in different regiments and units?		
Such projections obfuscate reality on the ground. Post-Independence, majority of Muslim officers and soldiers migrated to Pakistan, leaving a minuscule minority as the core or seed element of Indian Muslim servicemen distributed in different regiments and units.		

What is the claim about the Muslim regiment of the Indian Army's participation in the 1965 war with Pakistan, and what is the evidence provided to support this claim?		
It’s an issue very few in India know much about: Indian Muslim presence in India’s armed forces and issues concerning alleged disloyalty to the nation, on which across the board gullibility is very high.		

Was the Garhwal Rifles, a regiment with a predominantly Hindu recruitment base, one of the regiments that refused to fight in India's 1965 war with Pakistan?		
I, a Muslim, was commissioned in Garhwal Rifles, a pure Hindu regiment with recruitment base only in Garhwal in Uttarakhand.		

Is the Indian Army's regimental structure based on caste, and if not, what does this have to do with the claim that Muslim regiments refused to fight in India's 1965 war with Pakistan?		
No, all the regiments in the Indian Army are not based on caste. For instance, Rajputana Rifles have an equal number of Rajputs and Jats.		

Are there any Muslim-only sub-units in the Indian Army that refused to fight in India's 1965 war with Pakistan?		
However, sub units comprising only Muslims do exist in many units of the Grenadiers, the Rajputana Rifles, Rajput Regiment and some cavalry regiments.

""AARP does not have any record of direct contributions to political parties or candidates based on my review of federal campaign finance and tax filings covering recent years, but AARP’s officers [executives] and employees can still make political donations in a personal capacity, and contributions from donors listing AARP as their employer in Federal Election Commission records have primarily gone to Democratic candidates in recent years,"" said Anna Massoglia, a researcher for The Center for Responsive Politics.		

Is AARP allowed to make political contributions or engage in political activities?		
AARP spokesperson Jason Young told us by phone that the organization, as a 501(c)4 non-profit, is prohibited by law from making political contributions.		

What does AARP's policy state about its involvement in political campaigns and candidate endorsements?		
AARP does not endorse candidates or make contributions to political campaigns or candidates. We have a proud 32-year history of non-partisan voter engagement, providing voters with information on where the candidates stand on issues important to our members and their families, so they can make their own decisions on Election Day.		

Does AARP's policy prohibit it from contributing to political campaigns, including those of Democratic candidates?		
Because AARP as an organization has not contributed to the Democratic party or its candidates, we rate this claim, ""False.""		

Is AARP allowed to engage in some political campaign activity as a 501(c)4 organization?		
Massoglia said that as a 501(c)4 organization, the AARP is allowed under U.S. tax code to engage in some political campaign activity.		

Did AARP spend any money on TV ads targeting Republican candidates in the 2012 election cycle?		
According to OpenSecrets.org, AARP spent $29,826 in the 2012 election cycle. Open Secrets analyzed the success of 2012 general election cycle spending.[5]		

Is AARP's lobbying efforts at the state and national governmental level related to its prohibition from involvement in any political campaigns?		
AARP is widely known for addressing issues affecting older Americans through a multitude of initiatives, including lobbying efforts at the state and national governmental level, an activity permitted by its 501(c)(4) status.		

Is AARP prohibited from involvement in any political campaigns, and if so, what is the evidence that supports this claim?		
According to OpenSecrets.org, AARP spent $23,138 in the 2014 election cycle. Open Secrets analyzed the success of 2014 general election cycle spending.[4]		

What does AARP's senior vice president of external relations say about the organization's political involvement?		
""AARP is strictly nonpartisan,"" Jason Young, AARP's senior vice president of external relations said, further noting that nonpartisanship is a standard at AARP — and also the law.		

Can AARP employees make political donations to support or oppose specific candidates?		
While AARP itself does not — and cannot — make political donations, the company's ""rank-and-file employees have the right to give (political donations),"" Young said.

McDonald’s has generally maintained a “hands-off” policy towards franchisees. Last year, however, the National Labor Relations Board ruled that McDonald’s could be held liable for labor violations at its franchises.		

Has McDonald's made a statement regarding the claim that they are taking down American flags at their fast-food restaurants in support of Black Lives Matter and antifa?		
McDonald’s said it will comment after it has seen the lawsuit. It said: “McDonald’s has a long-standing history of embracing the diversity of employees, independent franchisees, customers and suppliers, and discrimination is completely inconsistent with our values.		

Did McDonald's corporate management make a conscious decision regarding the handling of claims about taking down American flags at their fast-food restaurants?		
McDonald's corporate legal department was fully aware of these hoaxes and had documented them. The evidence supports the reasonable conclusion that McDonald's corporate management made a conscious decision not to train or warn store managers or employees about the calls.		

Did McDonald's take down American flags at their fast-food restaurants in support of Black Lives Matter and antifa?		
A McDonald's spokesman said the comments made by Mr Vigors were ""unacceptable"" and did ""not reflect the beliefs of the company as an inclusive workplace"".		

Is there any evidence that McDonald's took down American flags at their fast-food restaurants in support of Black Lives Matter and antifa?		
The actions of McDonald's employees, as clearly shown by the record, qualify as sexual harassment pursuant to the KCRA.		

Has McDonald's ever taken down American flags at their fast-food restaurants in support of Black Lives Matter and antifa?		
There is no evidence to support this. McDonald’s says that is not the case. And McDonald’s discontinued a related practice, barring workers from moving from one store inside the company to another, in 2017.		

Why did McDonald's not comment on the claim that they took down American flags at their fast-food restaurants in support of Black Lives Matter and antifa, despite having taken a stance on a different social issue?		
McDonald’s has condemned the actions of a franchisee who was caught on camera abusing his neighbour over his Indigenous heritage, after the video went viral on social media.		

Did McDonald's take down American flags at their fast-food restaurants in support of Black Lives Matter and antifa?		
There was also evidence that McDonald's intentionally withheld information from those stores not yet targeted by the caller which would have been helpful in avoiding similar incidents.		

Did McDonald's take down American flags at their fast-food restaurants in support of Black Lives Matter and antifa?		
Just as significantly, McDonald's acknowledged in several pleadings, and during certain hearings, that Summers was pursuing an IIED claim.		

Is the claim that McDonald's took down American flags at their fast-food restaurants in support of Black Lives Matter and antifa true?		
McDonald's cited numerous cases in support of its argument regarding apportioning liability to the unknown caller.

Did a Rafale Aircraft owned by India crash during a training session, resulting in the death of two pilots?

Tourism is an important part of New Zealand's economy. For the fiscal year that ended in March 2020, tourism made up 5.5 percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) and is a major employer.		

How significant was the contribution of tourism to New Zealand's economy before the COVID-19 pandemic?		
Before COVID-19, tourism was New Zealand's largest export industry and delivered $40.9 billion to the country.		

How did the lockdown and tourism industry affect New Zealand's economy?		
The coronavirus outbreak will have a serious impact on New Zealand’s economy in the short term, the finance minister has said, and the government may need to step in if the economic situation deteriorates.		

How does the containment of the coronavirus and the subsequent short, sharp impact on the global economy in the first half of 2020 relate to the claim that tourism and lockdown are key to a deep New Zealand recession?

New Zealand has only eight confirmed and two probable cases of Covid-19.

Therefore, changes between these two years must be interpreted with that difference in mind. Overall, the annual number of legal induced abortions in the United States increased gradually from 1973 until it peaked in 1990, and it generally declined thereafter (Figure 1).		

What was the change in the abortion rate from 1997 to 1998, and what factors may have contributed to this change?		
The abortion rate in 1998 experienced a significant loss of information from some reporting areas. The abortion rate changed from 20 in 1997 to 17 in 1998, with a modest decline in the following years for 49 reporting areas.		

Does the decline in adolescent pregnancies and abortions from 2012 to 2013 support the claim that the rate of abortions under Democratic presidential administrations has actually fallen more precipitously?		
The 12% decrease from 2012 to 2013 in the abortion rate for adolescents aged 15–19 years suggests that adolescent pregnancies in the United States continue to decrease and that this decrease continues to be accompanied by substantial decreases in adolescent abortions as well as live births.

Are Antifa groups known for participating in protests and rallies that involve far-right participants, and have they been involved in violent confrontations with such groups in the past?		
Antifa groups have been increasingly active in protests and rallies over the past few years, especially ones that include far-right participants.41 In June 2016, for example, Antifa and other protestors confronted a neo-Nazi rally in Sacramento, CA, where at least five people were stabbed.		

Does the Department of Justice have direct evidence of widespread involvement of antifa followers in the violence seen thus far across the country?

The flyer has circulated online before in 2017 and 2019, as well as in 2020. Conspiracy theories about anti-fascist groups rioting on Nov. 4 are common, especially across the conservative parts of the internet.		

Is there any evidence that Antifa is recruiting people to dress as President Trump supporters and police to riot on Election Day 2020 in the United States?		
The escalating use of force against demonstrators comes amid a wider push to militarize the government’s response to domestic unrest, and particularly demonstrations perceived to be linked to left-wing groups like Antifa, which the administration views as a “terrorist” organization (New York Times, 31 May 2020).

363,Antifa Admit to Igniting Fires All Over The Country To Draw Attention To Climate Change,"Is there any evidence that Antifa is involved in igniting fires across the country to draw attention to climate change?		
The escalating use of force against demonstrators comes amid a wider push to militarize the government’s response to domestic unrest, and particularly demonstrations perceived to be linked to left-wing groups like Antifa, which the administration views as a “terrorist” organization (New York Times, 31 May 2020).		

Does the evidence suggest that Antifa is admitting to igniting fires all over the country to draw attention to climate change?		
Although these incidents account for a small subset of demonstrations, the trend has become another battlefield for the hyper-partisan “culture wars” over America’s history of racism (Bloomberg, 7 June 2020), and a lightning rod for polarized debate over an appropriate response to the ongoing protest movement.		

What is the purpose of the demonstrations mentioned in the evidence, according to the trendlines presented?		
While these data present only a snapshot of demonstration activity and political violence in America, the trendlines are clear: demonstrations have erupted en masse around the country, and they are increasingly met with violence by state actors, non-state actors, and counter-demonstrators alike.

Do the arrested individuals for arson claim to be affiliated with Antifa, and are they using the fires to draw attention to climate change?		
Well, the people that have been arrested for arson so far, are BLM, antifa shit stains. Not white supremacists or “outside” terrorists.		

Are there any credible reports or admissions from Antifa or any other group claiming responsibility for igniting fires across the country to draw attention to climate change?		
Despite the media focus on looting and vandalism, however, there is little evidence to suggest that demonstrators have engaged in widespread violence.		

What is the connection between the reported destructive activity and the goal of drawing attention to climate change?		
It was one of the first reports of destructive activity that day, and it “created an atmosphere of hostility and tension” that helped spark an outbreak of looting following initially peaceful protests, according to police investigators, who believe the man “wanted to sow discord and racial unrest” (New York Times, 28 July 2020).		

Did Antifa admit to igniting fires all over the country to draw attention to climate change?		
At least 50 such incidents have been reported around the country since 24 May. Reports that police not only tolerate the presence of certain armed individuals at demonstrations (Washington Post, 30 August 2020; Huffington Post, 28 August 2020), but in some cases actively encourage their involvement suggest this trend will continue, amplifying the risk of violence.		

Did Antifa admit to igniting fires all over the country to draw attention to climate change?		
President Trump tweeted a message of condolences for the deceased, alleging that he had been “murdered in Portland by ANTIFA” (Insider, 31 August 2020), despite the fact that it remains unclear who is responsible for the shooting.11Since initial publication, the suspect has been identified as Michael Reinoehl, who stated in an interview that he “was not a ‘member’ of antifa, but supported the ideology” (Washington Post, 4 September 2020).		

Is there any evidence in the provided evidence that suggests Antifa admits to igniting fires all over the country to draw attention to climate change?		
Research from the University of Washington indicates that this disparity stems from political orientation and biased media framing (Washington Post, 24 August 2020), such as disproportionate coverage of violent demonstrations (Business Insider, 11 June 2020; Poynter, 25 June 2020).

389,The cardinal and unforgivable sin of a French magazine Charlie Hebdo in insulting the holy face of the Prophet once again revealed the hatred and hostility of the political and cultural institutions of the Western world against Islam and the Muslim community.,"What was the target of the attack in Paris, and how did it relate to the claim of the hatred and hostility of the Western world against Islam and the Muslim community?		
Wednesday's deadly attack in Paris on the French satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo is the latest in a series of assaults aimed at Western publications that have provocatively depicted the Prophet Muhammad in inflammatory cartoons.		

What was the motivation behind the attack on Charlie Hebdo's office, and how does it relate to the claim that the magazine's insults towards the Prophet revealed the hatred and hostility of Western institutions towards Islam and the Muslim community?		
The motivation behind the attack that has left at least 12 people dead at the office of French satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo on Wednesday appears to be its long history of mocking religions, in particular Islam.		

What was the purpose of Charlie Hebdo's work, according to the evidence?		
In Charlie Hebdo's case, it was about satire on the face of it – but more than that, their work was about the very urgent need to preserve free expression, and to condemn – in any and all ways possible – those who seek to destroy it.		

Was the killing of the Charlie Hebdo staff the first time Islamists have made a point of murdering journalists or commentators, or the first time they have risen up against satirists in the West?		
The killing of the Charlie Hebdo staff was not the first time Islamists have made a point of murdering journalists or commentators, or the first time they have risen up against satirists in the West.		

Did Western commentators, including Western Muslims, condemn the cartoonists of Charlie Hebdo for their depiction of the Prophet's face?		
Shockingly, even Western commentators (and especially Western Muslims) condemned the cartoonists in Denmark, just as they condemned Theo van Gogh and, today, Charlie Hebdo for ""inviting"" these attacks through their ""recklessness.""		

How did the publication of Charlie Hebdo's controversial issue affect the magazine's sales and the response from French President Jacques Chirac?		
The issue saw unusually high sales, but drew criticism from many Muslim groups. France’s then President Jacques Chirac released a statement at the time saying, “Anything that can hurt the convictions of someone else, in particular religious convictions, should be avoided.		

How did the Charlie Hebdo magazine's publication of cartoons featuring a figure resembling the Prophet Muhammad relate to the subsequent massacre of its editors and cartoonists by Islamic gunmen?		
With the massacre of Charlie Hebdo magazine's editors and cartoonists in Paris by Islamic gunmen early Wednesday afternoon, the forces of radical Islam lay the gauntlet down: radical Islam is not just fighting against Western freedom, or the hegemony of Western powers.		

How did the White House spokesman Jay Carney comment on the publications of cartoons featuring a figure resembling the Prophet Muhammad?		
Perhaps in this, Charlie Hebdo was way ahead of the rest of us: they, along with the editors of the Danish Jyllands Posten, which first published the ""Mohammed cartoons,"" have been fighting back from the very start.		

Has Charlie Hebdo's publication of cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad been a regular occurrence, or was it a one-time event that sparked controversy?		
The Parisian weekly, and its editor Stephane Charbonnier, who was shot dead in the latest violence, were at the forefront of publications testing the boundaries of the right of freedom of expression that is common in Western countries.		

How does the evidence provided relate to the claim that the Charlie Hebdo magazine's cartoons are an example of the hatred and hostility of Western institutions against Islam and the Muslim community?		
Viewed in a vacuum, the Charlie Hebdo cartoons (or the Danish ones that preceded it) are hardly worthy of a stirring defense.

The NBA does not have tax-exempt status, and Major League Baseball gave its up in 2007. The NHL still is tax-exempt.		

Are the NFL, NBA, and MLB exempt from taxes due to their specific classification under Section 501(c)(6) of the IRS code?		
Some critics have maintained that the NFL (and the NFL alone, not other sports leagues) was tax-exempt due to a special ""loophole"" inserted into the tax code in 1966, referencing Section 501(c)(6) of the IRS code, a section that specifically includes ""Professional football leagues"" along with ""business leagues, chambers of commerce, real-estate boards, or boards of trade"" as tax-exempt organizations.		

What type of tax-exempt status do the NFL, NBA, and MLB have, and how does it differ from the tax-exempt status of charitable organizations?		
According to league spokesman Brian McCarthy, the NFL is organized as a trade or industry association that is exempt from taxation under Section 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code, not Section 501(c)(3), which exempts charitable organizations.		

Does the NBA league office currently have tax-exempt status?		
Major League Baseball decided to forgo its tax-exempt status in 2007. The NHL, PGA and LPGA still have this distinction, while the NBA league office has never been classified as tax-exempt.		

What type of organization is the NFL registered as, which allows it to be exempt from paying taxes?		
The reason the NFL doesn’t pay taxes is beyond outdated at this point. The league is a registered 501(c)(6), which “provides for exemption of business leagues, chambers of commerce, real estate boards, boards of trade, and professional football leagues.”		

What is the tax status of the NFL League Office and the individual NFL teams?		
While the NFL League Office was exempt from paying federal income taxes under Section 501(c)(6), each of the individual NFL teams have paid and will continue to pay taxes annually on the individual team’s share of the league’s overall earnings.[5]		

Did the NFL, NBA, or MLB benefit from being tax-exempt, according to the evidence provided?		
It's unclear how much of a benefit ending the tax-exempt status of professional sports leagues would bring directly to taxpayers, largely because the complexity of how the leagues have structured their businesses makes it hard to know how much they benefit directly from being tax-exempt (Major League Baseball claims that giving up its tax-exempt status in 2007 had no effect on its annual taxes		

What type of tax-exempt status did the NFL have prior to the 1966 IRS decision?		
Prior to this decision, the NFL was considered a trade association under Section 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code, which exempted the league from paying federal income tax.[2] In 1966, after successful lobbying by the league, the Internal Revenue Service rewrote Section 501(c)(6) of the Code specifically to include “professional football leagues” as associations exempt from paying federal income taxes.[3]		

Did the NFL, NBA, and MLB have tax-exempt status at the time the evidence was written (assuming the evidence is from a specific date or time period)?		
All Section 501(c)(6) tax-exempt organizations are required to make certain disclosures annually, including information such as income and activities over the year.[14] Other professional sports leagues have abandoned their tax-exempt status to avoid disclosing the salaries of their top executives; this consequence may have tempted the NFL to do the same.[15]		

Which professional sports leagues among the NFL, NBA, and MLB have historically had tax-exempt status?		
Major League Baseball (MLB) dropped its tax exemption in 2007.[10] In contrast, the National Basketball Association (NBA) has never been tax exempt.[11]

The strange reddish sky reported over parts of the UK may appear to some a sign of impending apocalypse or a celestial Instagram filter, but experts say there is a scientific explanation.		

What atmospheric conditions, such as ash from a large wildfire or a recent volcanic eruption, can cause the sky to appear orange to blood red?		
The brightness of the colors can also be affected by atmospheric conditions. Extra particles in the atmosphere, such as ash from a large wildfire or a recent volcanic eruption, may cause the moon to appear a darker shade of red, according to NASA.		

What is the significance of the orange to blood red coloration of the sky in several parts of the United States?		
As with red sunsets, the unusual Moon coloration might be pleasing to the eye, but it is a sign of poor air quality.		

What is the likely cause of the orange to blood red coloration of the sky in several parts of the United States?		
- Smoke from the fires is filling the atmosphere in many areas along the West Coast, causing skies to turn eerie shades of orange and red.		

What is the relationship between the presence of particles in the atmosphere and the color of the sunset?		
For this reason, the sunsets have a reddish-orange hue. The effect of a red sunset becomes more pronounced if the atmosphere contains more and more particles.		

Is the term ""blood red"" used to describe the color of the sky because of the presence of dust, smoke, or haze in the atmosphere?		
The name ""blood moon"" is also sometimes used for a Moon that appears reddish because of dust, smoke or haze in the sky.		

What is the relationship between the presence of small particles in the air and the color of the sunset, as observed in the sky turning orange to blood red in several parts of the United States?		
If the air is polluted with small particles, natural or otherwise, the sunset will be more red. Sunsets over the sea may also be orange, due to salt particles in the air, which are effective Tyndall scatterers.		

What is the effect of large numbers of big particles in the troposphere on the appearance of the sunset?		
For example, the sunset can appear bright but washed out when large numbers of big particles accumulate in the troposphere, the layer of the atmosphere closest to the ground.		

What is the likely cause of the sky turning orange to blood red in several parts of the United States, given the presence of dust and moisture particles in the atmosphere?		
A red sky suggests an atmosphere loaded with dust and moisture particles. We see the red, because red wavelengths (the longest in the color spectrum) are breaking through the atmosphere.		

Is the orange to blood red color of the sky in several parts of the United States due to human-made aerosols?		
The most heavily polluted cities in the world also tend to have more orange and red sunsets, resulting from an abundance of human-made aerosols.

Noteworthy is the fact that Fiat-Chrysler has announced that it will invest $1 billion in a factory in Warren, Michigan, which will come with the creation of 2,500 jobs.		

Have any new auto assembly plants been added under Trump's administration?		
The move would add 2,500 jobs in Metro Detroit by 2020, when the plant retooling is completed, the automaker said.		

Did the number of auto assembly plants increase in Michigan, Ohio, North Carolina, and South Carolina during Trump's presidency?		
“Domestic and foreign automakers and their suppliers have been investing billions in U.S. facilities — plants, R&D centers — for decades, and particularly since the U.S. emerged from the Great Recession,” she said.

Have any new auto assembly plants been opened or had new investment under Trump's administration?		
Ford Motor said in March that it would build a new light assembly plant for small cars in Mexico, continuing a trend of automakers increasing production there because of lower wages and favorable trade laws and more 'importantly' big car and truck production of all of the Big Three will stay in the United States.		

What type of investments has General Motors made in the United States under the Trump administration, according to the evidence provided?		
- Significance: General Motors (GM) has released an overview of a planned USD1-billion investment in the United States, which will include shifting production of truck axles from Mexico to the United States for next-generation pickup trucks.		

Has the expansion of auto assembly plants under Trump's administration been limited to the mentioned states, or have there been instances where production has increased in other countries, such as Mexico?		
But Rep. Sander Levin, D-Royal Oak, noted that despite Trump’s talk about industry returning from Mexico, the South Korean automaker Kia has decided to expand production 40 percent in Mexico.

Here’s how one paper, “Public health lessons learned from biases in coronavirus mortality overestimation”, put it: “On March 11, 2020... based on the data available at the time, Congress was informed that the estimated mortality rate for the coronavirus was ten-times higher than for seasonal influenza, which helped launch a campaign of social distancing, organizational and business lockdowns, and shelter-in-place orders.”		

What specific mistake is alleged to have been made by Dr. Fauci that led to panic and lockdowns?		
In the original version of this article, the headline read “The 1% blunder: How a simple but fatal math mistake by US Covid-19 experts caused the world to panic and order lockdowns,” and the article accused Dr. Fauci of having mixed up different fatality rates when he presented his evidence to Congress on March 11.

Another government study also found Professor Ferguson and his team at Imperial College used models during the foot and mouth crisis that “were not suitable for predicting the course of the epidemic and the effects of control measures.		

Did Dr. Anthony Fauci's statement about the case fatality rate of COVID-19 being similar to that of seasonal flu contribute to the panic and lockdowns ordered by U.S. leaders?		
At least one governor, Jay Inslee of Washington, focused on an entirely different metric. Even if ‘case fatality rate’ were the driving force, a March 2020 editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine authored by Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, did not blunder, correctly stating what was known at that time about the ratio of fatalities to cases of both seasonal flu and COVID-19.”		

Did Professor Ferguson's revised prediction of the potential death toll lead to a change in the lockdown measures implemented by the British government?		
After an outcry about his changing stance, Professor Ferguson insisted he had been consistent throughout the crisis and that the revised prediction of the potential death toll was because of the strict lockdown put in place by the British government after following his advice.		

What type of fatality rate was substituted for another, leading to an incorrect prediction of the likely death rate?		
With Covid, a similar mistake happened. One type of fatality rate was substituted for another. The wrong rate was then used to predict the likely death rate – and, as with NASA, no-one picked up the error.		

What mistake is supposed to have been made by Dr. Fauci that led to different predictions about COVID-19 and subsequent panic among U.S. leaders?

Does the study's finding that masks are effective in limiting transmission of respiratory viruses support the claim that face masks do not help prevent the spread of coronavirus?		
Although the study did not look at COVID-19 specifically, the findings support mask wearing as an effective way to limit transmission of the virus from an infected person—known in medical parlance as source control.		

Can cloth masks effectively block the exhalation of fine droplets and particles, including those that may carry the coronavirus, and thus help prevent the spread of the virus?		
""Cloth masks not only effectively block most large droplets -- 20-30 microns and larger -- but they can also block the exhalation of fine droplets and particles, also often referred to as aerosols,"" according to the CDC.		

Can the video of a man blowing vape smoke through various face masks accurately demonstrate the effectiveness of face masks in preventing the spread of coronavirus?		
Fabric masks, if made and worn properly, can serve as a barrier to droplets expelled from the wearer into the air and environment.(12)		

Do face masks help prevent the spread of coronavirus by blocking larger particles created by sneezing or coughing?		
The claim is misleading, according to health experts. The virus spreads as part of larger particles -- created by sneezing or coughing -- that are effectively blocked by face masks, they said.

What did Donald Trump promise to do during his presidential campaign?		
During the presidential campaign, Donald Trump adopted a populist platform promising to “drain the swamp” and return government to the people.

Does the evidence support the claim that the Uighur population had the region's highest birthrate, at about 12 newborns per 1,000 people in Xinjiang, China, between 2010 and 2018?		
The growth rate of the Uygur population in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region from 2010 to 2018 was higher than the rest of the region, including the growth rate of people from the Han ethnic group, according to the latest research that disproves claims in a report published by a German scholar.		

Does the evidence suggest that the Uighur population in Xinjiang had the region's highest birthrate at about 12 newborns per 1,000 people between 2010 and 2018, given that birth rates in the mostly Uighur regions of Hotan and Kashgar actually plummeted by more than 60% from 2015 to 2018?		
Birth rates in the mostly Uighur regions of Hotan and Kashgar plunged by more than 60% from 2015 to 2018, the latest year available in government statistics.		

Does the evidence suggest that the birthrate of the Uighur population in Xinjiang, China, has actually decreased significantly between 2010 and 2018, contradicting the claim that it had the region's highest birthrate during this period?		
Birth rates in the mostly Uighur regions of Hotan and Kashgar have plunged by more than 60% since 2015, government statistics show.		

Does the evidence suggest that the Uighur population had the region's highest birthrate at about 12 newborns per 1,000 people in Xinjiang, China, between 2010 and 2018?		
Xinjiang's population has continued to grow in recent years, and the birth rate of the Uygur population have been higher than Xinjiang's average level.		

Does the evidence suggest that the Uighur population's birthrate was the highest in Xinjiang between 2010 and 2018, or does it only indicate that the Uighur population was increasing steadily during this period?		
The data from 2010 to 2018 show Xinjiang's total population has increased steadily, including that of the Uygur population, whereas the Han population in the region has registered just a meager increase.		

Does the evidence suggest that the Uighur population had the region's highest birthrate, at about 12 newborns per 1,000 people in Xinjiang, China, between 2010 and 2018, given that the birth rate and natural population growth rate of Xinjiang's population were stable while slowing slightly during this period?		
From 2010 to 2018, the birth rate and natural population growth rate of Xinjiang's population were stable while slowing slightly.		

Does the evidence suggest that the Uighur population in Xinjiang, China had the region's highest birthrate between 2010 and 2018, as claimed?		
Uighurs have fewer children than they used to, but since 2010 the birth rate has been rising again. In mainly Uighur Kashgar, a prefecture which borders on Pakistan, Afghanistan and Central Asia, it is four times the national average.		

Does the evidence provided show a correlation between the birth rate of the Uighur population in Xinjiang, China and the non-Han Chinese population share in each region, and does this correlation support the claim that the Uighur population had the region's highest birthrate between 2010 and 2018?		
This repression includes a worsening position for fertility. The figure below shows the change in the officially reported crude birth rate among Chinese regions between 1998 and 2018, versus the non-Han Chinese population share in each region as measured in the 2000 census.

- While President Donald Trump has publicly vowed to protect Social Security benefits, his budget includes $71 billion in proposed cuts to the program, according to one Congressional estimate.		

How does the elimination of employee payroll taxes, as proposed by President Trump, affect the Social Security trust fund and its projected depletion date?		
As our analysis based on the Social Security trustees’ projections shows, eliminating employee payroll taxes along the lines that the president has proposed would, absent additional action, completely exhaust the Social Security trust fund by 2026 or earlier and result in steep benefit cuts.		

How would the elimination of the employee share of the Social Security tax, as proposed by President Trump, affect the depletion of the Social Security trust fund?		
- If in 2021, a second-term President Trump permanently eliminates the employee share of the Social Security tax along the lines that he has proposed for his temporary tax delay—limiting it to workers under the wage threshold—the combined trust fund would be exhausted five years later, in 2026, or nine years sooner than the actuaries predicted in April of this year.		

Does the evidence suggest that President Donald Trump's plan is to cut social security, resulting in social security becoming permanently depleted by the middle of calendar year 2023?		
- The Social Security Chief Actuary has confirmed that no one has proposed legislation to zero-out Social Security payroll taxes, and that past payroll tax holidays enacted by President Obama provided General Fund transfers to offset effects on Social Security’s trust funds.		

Does the evidence suggest that US President Donald Trump's plan to cut social security will result in social security becoming permanently depleted by the middle of calendar year 2023?		
* According to the trustees’ latest projections, the trust fund ensures that Social Security beneficiaries can count on all of their promised benefits until 2035, giving Congress enough time to address Social Security’s longer-term financial shortfall.		

How would President Trump's plan to cut Social Security taxes for the last four months of the year affect the projected exhaustion date of the Social Security trust fund?		
- Cutting the tax due for the last four months of this year, as Trump wants, would result in the combined Social Security trust fund being exhausted in 2034 rather than 2035, as under the trustees’ April projections.		

How does the current financial situation of the Social Security trust funds impact the claim that President Trump's plan to cut social security will result in its permanent depletion by the middle of calendar year 2023?		
The trust funds for both programs already are running short of money. The Social Security fund is expected to be unable to pay all its obligations by 2035 (probably sooner when the effects of the current economic slump are taken into account).		

Does the White House confirm that the Social Security Trust Fund is at risk of depletion by 2023?		
An official from the White House told USA TODAY on Tuesday that the Social Security Trust Fund is not at risk, since payment deferral is only temporary, and at present, must be paid back early in 2021.		

How long will the Social Security trust fund last without new tax revenue, according to Nancy Altman, the president of Social Security Works?

418,People are trying to lower the legal age of consent to four years old in the U.S.,"What is the current age range of legal age of consent in the US, and how does it affect a person's ability to legally consent to sexual activity?		
A person younger than the legal age of consent cannot legally consent to sexual activity. The age of consent in the United States ranges from 16 to 18 years old depending on the state, meaning that a person 15 years of age or younger cannot legally consent to sexual contact.		

What is the current legal status of the age of consent in the United States, and how does it vary across different states?		
Only 12 states have a single age of consent, below which an individual cannot consent to sexual intercourse under any circumstances, and above which it is legal to engage in sexual intercourse with another person above the age of consent.		

What is the current range of legal age of consent in the United States, and are there any efforts to change it?		
The age of consent varies by jurisdiction, with some states setting it at 16 years old and others setting it as high as 18 years old.		

What is the minimum age below which an individual cannot legally engage in sexual intercourse in the United States, according to the evidence provided?		
Minimum age requirement. In 27 states that do not have a single age of consent, statutes specify the age below which an individual cannot legally engage in sexual intercourse regardless of the age of the defendant (see the second column in Table 1).		

What is the minimum age below which a law typically establishes it is illegal for someone to consent to sexual activity in the United States?		
“age of consent” in statute.  Instead, a law will generally establish the age below which it is 		

Is there any evidence to suggest that the age of consent is being lowered to four years old in the US, or is the claim incorrect and the evidence provided actually discussing existing laws and exceptions in certain states?		
As mentioned in the chart above, the age of consent in Texas is 17. Texas, as well as many other states, has created a so-called “Romeo and Juliet” law, an exception to the statutory rape and age of consent law.		

Is there a uniform age of consent for all 50 states in the United States, and if not, what is the minimum age at which a person may consent to participation in sexual intercourse?		
No, there is not a uniform age of consent. The “Age of Consent” is the minimum age at which a person may consent to participation in sexual intercourse.		

Do the laws regarding the age of consent vary from state to state in the United States?		
Each state enacts its owns laws which set the age of consent. If someone engages in sexual activity with a person younger than the age of consent in that state, the person could be charged with Statutory Rape or other offenses depending on the nature of the contact.		

What is the current range of legal ages of consent in the United States, and how do these ages vary by jurisdiction?

On April 3, 2020, the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics issued guidance to physicians, coroners, and medical examiners who fill out death certificates to list COVID-19 as an underlying cause of death in the absence of a test ""if the circumstances are compelling within a reasonable degree of certainty.""		

How does the CDC define and categorize deaths involving COVID-19, and what is the distinction between ""due to COVID-19"" and ""involving COVID-19"" in their reporting of COVID-19 deaths?		
- In this report, we use the term “due to COVID-19” when referring only to deaths with an underlying cause of death as the coronavirus (COVID-19) and the term “involving COVID-19” when referring to deaths that had COVID-19 mentioned anywhere on the death certificate, whether as underlying cause or not.

In this article, we use the term “due to COVID-19” when referring only to deaths with an underlying cause of death as COVID-19, and we use the term “involving COVID-19” when referring to deaths that had COVID-19 mentioned anywhere on the death certificate, whether as underlying cause or not.		

Are deaths from poisoning, trauma, and unintentional injury being included in the CDC's tally of COVID-19 deaths when COVID-19 is recorded as a cause of death on the death certificate, or are these deaths only included when COVID-19 is the sole cause of death?		
Where only COVID-19 was recorded on the death certificate, or COVID-19 and subsequent conditions caused by COVID-19 were recorded, we refer to these deaths as having “No pre-existing conditions”.		

What percentage of deaths attributed to COVID-19 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are directly related to the coronavirus, and what percentage may be attributed to other causes such as poisoning, trauma, and unintentional injury?		
Of these, 8% involved the coronavirus (COVID-19) (3,912 deaths). The doctor certifying a death can list all causes in the chain of events that led to the death and pre-existing conditions that may have contributed to the death.		

Does the evidence provided support the claim that the CDC fraudulently adds deaths from poisoning, trauma, and unintentional injury to their tally of COVID-19 deaths, or does it clarify the process of documenting a death, stating that when the evidence tells you that COVID-19 was the likely cause of death, then you should report it as the likely cause of death, whether you have a lab test or not?		
- Based on deaths involving the coronavirus (COVID-19) rather than deaths where COVID-19 was the underlying cause of death.		

How do the provisional counts of deaths in the United States due to COVID-19, as reported by the CDC, account for deaths from poisoning, trauma, and unintentional injury, and what is the evidence that these deaths are being fraudulently added to the tally of COVID-19 deaths?		
The provisional data presented on this page include the provisional counts of deaths in the United States due to COVID-19, deaths from all causes and percent of expected deaths (i.e., number of deaths received over number of deaths expected based on data from previous years), pneumonia deaths (excluding pneumonia deaths involving influenza), pneumonia deaths involving COVID-19, influenza deaths, and deaths involving pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19; by week ending date, month, and year, and specific jurisdictions.		

Does the CDC's provisional death count, which is based on death certificates, include information on comorbid conditions, race and ethnicity, and place of death, which could potentially affect the accuracy of the tally of COVID-19 deaths?		
Provisional death counts deliver the most complete and accurate picture of lives lost to COVID-19. They are based on death certificates, which are the most reliable source of data and contain information not available anywhere else, including comorbid conditions, race and ethnicity, and place of death.		

What percentage of deaths with an underlying cause of COVID-19 were classified as ""suspected"" COVID-19, and does this suggest that the CDC is fraudulently adding deaths from other causes to their tally of COVID-19 deaths?		
Of the 3,372 deaths with an underlying cause of COVID-19, 38 (1%) were classified as “suspected” COVID-19.		

Does the CDC's definition of a COVID-19 death include cases where a positive test result is not required, and if so, how does this impact the accuracy of the reported COVID-19 death toll?		
This means a positive COVID-19 test result is not required for a death to be registered as COVID-19. In some circumstances, depending on national guidelines, medical practitioners can record COVID-19 deaths if they think the signs and symptoms point towards this as the underlying cause.

Did Sen. Martha McSally support a balanced-budget amendment that could potentially lead to cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security?		
One example McSally’s campaign provided: Sinema in April 2018 voted in favor of a ""balanced-budget amendment,"" which House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi described as ""an act of breathtaking hypocrisy and an open assault on Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security,"" and one ""purpose-built to force devastating cuts in Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.""		

Did Sen. Martha McSally support specific legislation that would have turned Medicare into a voucher program and shifted costs onto seniors, or were her votes indirectly related to potential cuts in Medicare and restructuring of Social Security?		
The website’s claim is broad; Sinema’s team said McSally was its target. While some votes cast by McSally could have indirectly led to cuts in Medicare and a restructuring of Social Security, those votes were for not for measures that would have become law.		

Did Sen. Martha McSally support a plan to turn Medicare into a voucher program and shift costs onto seniors, and did she support raising the retirement age?		
While Sinema’s team said her website’s claim was only directed toward McSally, other candidates in the race, including Republicans Ward and Arpaio, told PolitiFact they opposed cuts to Medicare, Social Security, and raising the retirement age.		

What changes to Medicare did Sen. Martha McSally support, and how do these changes relate to the Affordable Care Act?		
Its main purpose was to facilitate repeal of the Affordable Care Act. But the resolution did create the possibility of making changes to Medicare that could be interpreted as cuts, said Paul N. Van de Water, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, where he specializes in Medicare, Social Security, and health coverage issues.

Therefore, despite President Trump’s talk of total authority to force States to reopen their economies, in reality, there are few constitutional avenues available to him to compel them to do so.		

Does President Trump have the authority to order states to reopen their economies, reversing stay-at-home orders and business closures, according to the Constitution and the Youngstown case?		
Thus, while President Trump claims plenary authority to order the States to reopen their economies, reversing stay-at-home orders and business closures, the Constitution and Youngstown say the opposite.		

Did US President Trump issue an executive order to reopen states in lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic, or did he issue guidelines developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that offer states a phased approach to reopening their economies based on reductions in COVID-19 cases?		
Trump issues guidelines developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that offer states a phased approach to reopening their economies based on reductions in COVID-19 cases.		

Does President Trump believe he has the authority to order states to reopen during the COVID-19 pandemic, and if so, does this align with the powers granted to the President by the U.S. Constitution?		
President Trump at a briefing Monday night made an assertion that likely would have surprised the framers of the U.S. Constitution: that as president, his authority is ""total"" and that he has the power to order states — which have told businesses to close and people to remain at home to limit the spread of the coronavirus — to reopen.		

Does the evidence suggest that President Trump has the authority to issue an executive order to reopen states in lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic, and if not, what are the implications for his claim?		
Any action by President Trump, without the express or implied authority of Congress, ordering businesses back to work in defiance of State laws would thus be presumptively unconstitutional much in the same way the Court viewed President Truman’s actions in Youngstown.		

Does President Trump have the authority to issue an executive order to reopen states in lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic, and if not, what are the implications for governors who refuse to comply?		
""Trump has no authority to ease social distancing, or to open schools or private businesses,"" she said.		

Did President Trump issue an executive order to reopen states in lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic, and what were the consequences for governors who refused to comply?		
As such, regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal government can neither order those States with stay-at-home orders to repeal those orders nor dictate that States with no such orders refrain from issuing any future stay-at-home orders.		

Can the President of the United States issue an executive order to reopen states in lockdown during a pandemic, and if so, what are the limits of his authority in this regard?		
The president can declare national emergencies, Moss says, which Trump did on March 13, and even designate select groups for quarantine, but none of his authorities permit him to dictate how entire states open or close.

436,The US military will check purity and distribute COVID-19 vaccines in US.,"Will the US military be directly involved in the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines in the US, or will they provide support through contract, logistics, and administrative services?		
While the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will remain the lead agency for the federal COVID-19 response, the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) expects to provide contract, logistics, and administrative support to the distribution process.		

Will the US military be involved in the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines in the US?		
The national effort to accelerate the development, manufacturing and distribution of a COVID-19 vaccine, called ""Operation Warp Speed,"" will hasten the delivery of that vaccine by conducting steps concurrently that normally would be conducted sequentially, senior administration officials said.		

Is the US military involved in the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines in the US?		
It is unlikely the military will be involved, either in the distribution of a vaccine or in deciding who gets those precious initial deliveries, officials from both the White House and Defense Department said.		

Will the US military be involved in checking the purity and distributing COVID-19 vaccines in the US?		
Immunizing the U.S. population against COVID-19 will likely require the single largest vaccination campaign ever undertaken and governors will play a key role in bringing together leaders from their state public health, immunization, and emergency management systems to design and execute the operation.		

Will the US military be responsible for ensuring the purity and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines in the US?		
Vaccine distribution involves health care and supply chains, as well as issues of efficiency, efficacy, and equality.		

Will the US military be involved in the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines in the US?		
Vaccine distribution was delegated to state and local jurisdictions, which were provided flexibility in deciding the best methods for distribution.

But for a COVID-19 vaccine, the official added, Operation Warp Speed and the federal government — not private companies — will be assuming the risk.		

Is the US military involved in the production and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines in the US?		
The Defense Department has also used its authorities and budget under the Defense Production Act to speed production of protective masks and equipment that will be needed to distribute a vaccine, including three contracts since May worth a total of $485 million for syringes and glass vials.		

Will the US military be involved in the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines in the US, or will it be handled by pharmaceutical manufacturers and their traditional distributors?

437,"A 21 year old can have sex with an 11-year-old, and not be listed on the sex registry as a sex offender","Can a 21-year-old who engages in consensual yet illegal sexual relations with an 11-year-old be exempt from registering as a sex offender, and if so, what factors would a judge consider when making this decision?		
Currently, for consensual yet illegal sexual relations between a teenager age 15 and over and a partner within 10 years of age, “sexual intercourse” (i.e., vaginal intercourse) does not require the offender to go onto the sex offender registry; rather, the judge decides based on the facts of the case whether sex offender registration is warranted or unwarranted.		

Is the 21-year-old's sexual activity with the 11-year-old considered legal under state law?		
This is considered statutory rape under state law. Statutory rape laws are based on the assumption that minors are incapable of giving informed consent to sexual activities.		

Does the existing law in California already allow judges to decide whether to require registration as a sex offender for certain sexual encounters between minors and individuals up to 10 years older?		
To be clear, this judicial discretion for sex offender registration is *already* the law for vaginal intercourse between a 15-17 year old and someone up to 10 years older.		

What is the misconception about statutory rape laws in the United States, according to the evidence provided?		
A common misperception about statutory rape is that state codes define a single age at which an individual can legally consent to sex.		

What is the legal definition of statutory rape and how does it relate to the age of consent in the given evidence?		
Generally, statutory rape laws define the age below which an individual is legally incapable of consenting to sexual activity.		

What is the age range of individuals that can be considered for statutory rape in North Carolina, and how does this relate to the claim that a 21-year-old can have sex with an 11-year-old and not be listed on the sex registry as a sex offender?		
The situation in which an act would be considered statutory rape differs by state. The crime of statutory rape in North Carolina is also referred to as “sexual offense of person who is 13, 14, or 15 years old.”		

Does the evidence suggest that a 21-year-old can have sex with an 11-year-old and not be listed on the sex registry as a sex offender?		
For example, under the state’s statutory rape laws, if a 16-year-old girl willingly has sex with her 23-year-old boyfriend, her boyfriend can be charged with statutory rape, since the girl, as a minor, is not legally capable of giving consent in the first place.		

What is the purpose of ""Romeo and Juliet laws"" in the United States, and how do they relate to the registration of sex offenders?		
In the United States, many states have adopted close-in-age exemptions. These laws, known as ""Romeo and Juliet laws"", provide that a person can legally have consensual sex with a minor provided that he or she is not more than a given number of years older, generally four years or less.[51][52] Some Romeo and Juliet laws (such as the law in Michigan)[53] do not make it legal for a person below the age of consent to have sex with a slightly older person, but may exempt the older partner from sex offender registration.		

What is the minimum age below which an individual cannot consent to sexual intercourse under any circumstances in the United States?		
Only 12 states have a single age of consent, below which an individual cannot consent to sexual intercourse under any circumstances, and above which it is legal to engage in sexual intercourse with another person above the age of consent.		

Can a 21-year-old have sex with an 11-year-old and avoid being listed on the sex registry as a sex offender, and if so, what factors would the judge consider in making this decision?		
For example, if an 18 year old straight man has vaginal intercourse with his 17 year old girlfriend, he is guilty of a crime, but he is not automatically required to register as a sex offender; instead, the judge will decide based on the facts of the case whether registration is warranted.

COVID-19 also appears to cause more severe illness more frequently than seasonal influenza. Part of this difference may be attributed to the fact that COVID-19 is caused by a new type of coronavirus, against which humans have no immunity.		

Is the claim that COVID-19 is a seasonal illness similar to the flu supported by the evidence that experts warn that warmer weather is unlikely to drive the disease away amid the ongoing pandemic?		
It is possible that COVID-19 could turn out to be a seasonal illness, similar to influenza. However, experts warn that, at least for now, amid the ongoing pandemic, warmer weather is unlikely to drive the disease away.		

How does the contagiousness of COVID-19 compare to seasonal influenza?		
One difference between COVID-19 and influenza is that the former appears to be more contagious than seasonal influenza.		

How does the superspreading activity of COVID-19 compare to the flu, and what implications does this have for the claim that the recent increase in cases is not a second wave of COVID-19 but rather the normal cold/flu season?		
Vulnerable populations and age groups are more susceptible to both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus, but COVID-19 has shown more superspreading activity than the flu (defined as an instance in which an individual has at least 8 transmissions of the disease to other people).		

How does the evidence suggest that the current surge in cases is related to the normal cold/flu season?		
A study published in the Journal of Medical Virology showed that coinfection of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus was common during the initial COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China, and patients who experienced coinfection had a higher risk of poor health outcomes.		

How do the symptoms of COVID-19 differ from those of the common cold and flu?		
Seasonal coronaviruses should not be confused with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Because flu and the common cold have similar symptoms, it can be difficult to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone.		

What is the relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and the upcoming 2020 to 2021 flu season?		
As the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues, one major point of uncertainty is the impact this novel pathogen will have during the upcoming 2020 to 2021 flu season.		

How does the current COVID-19 pandemic compare to previous flu seasons in terms of mortality rates from pneumonia and influenza?		
What we know is that in the current COVID-19 pandemic, the US has its highest mortality from pneumonia and influenza since 2004, although not yet reaching the rates observed during the influenza A H1N1 pandemic in 2009.		

Is it possible that the increase in cases during the winter months is due to the normal cold/flu season rather than a second wave of COVID-19?		
COVID-19 and influenza coinfection is rare. Screening studies report more cases, suggesting that unless screening patients with COVID-19, the coinfection remains undiagnosed and underestimated.		

How does the evidence suggest that COVID-19 is more contagious than the flu?		
Undoubtedly, these NPIs reduced influenza transmission as well, and the fact that, despite these mitigation strategies, COVID-19 continued to spread more prevalently than the flu indicated that SARS-CoV-2 is more contagious than influenza virus.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has changed its advice on face masks, saying they should be worn in public where social distancing is not possible to help stop the spread of coronavirus.		

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), what is the primary benefit of wearing masks against COVID-19, and how does it prevent the spread of the virus?		
Wearing masks against COVID-19 is beneficial in suppressing pandemic spread, not through preventing the wearer from being infected but by preventing the wearer from infecting others, according to suggestions from the World Health Organization (WHO, 2020a,b,c) and lessons from previous pandemics, such as the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic and the 2009 influenza A virus subtype H1N1 pandemic (Mniszewski et al., 2014; Leung et al., 2020).		

Does the World Health Organization recommend that face masks be used alone as a means of preventing the spread of COVID-19?		
The WHO's guidance on the use of medical masks makes clear that their use alone is insufficient to prevent the spread of COVID-19 without proper hand-washing and other measures to protect against human to human transmission.		

Does the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend wearing face masks as a measure to slow the spread of COVID-19?		
Public health experts unanimously agree that masks help slow the spread of Covid-19. The CDC and World Health Organization both released recommendations to the public to wear masks when social distancing is not possible.		

Does the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend the use of masks by community members during the COVID-19 pandemic, and if so, what is the basis for this recommendation?		
The deaths of healthcare workers from COVID-19 reflect this risk (Zhan et al., 2020). The use of masks by sick people, despite being the WHO's only recommendation for mask use by community members during COVID-19 pandemic, is supported by the smallest body of evidence.		

Does the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend the use of personal protective equipment, including face masks, for protection against COVID-19?		
The use of personal protective equipment for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been controversial, with differing guidelines issued by different agencies (Chen et al., 2020).		

Does the World Health Organization recommend the use of non-medical masks or face coverings as an added layer of protection against COVID-19 in areas where physical distancing is difficult to maintain?

445,Masks lower immune systems.,"Does wearing a face mask have a negative impact on the immune system?		
The claim is misleading; wearing a face mask does not negatively impact the immune system, according to health experts; as of July 2020, international health authorities and governments around the world recommended wearing face masks as part of efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19.		

Does the scientific evidence support the claim that wearing face masks weakens the immune system?		
The idea that wearing face masks weakens the immune system is not supported by scientific evidence. This article published on The Conversation illustrates how wearing even a cloth face covering can help to limit the spread of COVID-19 by blocking infectious droplets, which is the main mode of disease transmission.		

Does wearing a mask weaken the immune system, or does it actually help to keep the community safe by preventing the spread of COVID-19?		
Mask use does not weaken the ability of the immune system to fight infection. Instead, wearing a mask helps to keep your community safe by preventing the accidental spread of COVID-19 by people who are infected but do not show symptoms.		

Does wearing masks lower the efficiency of the human immune system?		
Posts that make statements such as: “Masks inhibit oxygen intake and increase CO2 intake, lowering efficiency of the human immune system, and do not stop viruses” or “Hypercapnia can be caused by rebreathing your own exhaled CO2 by wearing a mask continuously” can be found more and more on the Web.		

Does wearing a face mask protect the immune system from COVID-19?		
International health authorities maintain that wearing a face mask is safe and can in fact protect the immune system from the novel coronavirus, which causes the disease COVID-19.		

Does wearing a mask weaken the immune system?		
The claim that wearing masks would weaken the immune system is also unsupported by scientific evidence.		

Does prolonged wearing of face masks cause immunodeficiency?		
Prolonged wearing of face masks can cause problems such as discomfort, skin irritation, and even pressure ulcers[3], however immunodeficiency is not among the problems caused by prolonged face mask use.		

Can stress caused by wearing a mask weaken the immune system?		
Finally, while masks do not weaken the immune system, stress might. Now is a stressful time, and unfortunately, stress has been linked with changes in immune system function and increased risk of infections.		

Does wearing a mask have any impact on the immune system?		
There is no evidence that mask use weakens the immune system. We all have harmless types of bacteria living on the surface of our bodies, and evidence suggests that they might affect the way our immune systems behave, but wearing a mask does not make these bacteria go away.		

Does wearing a surgical mask for short periods of time have a significant impact on the immune system?		
It is unfortunate that these posts are not supported by rigorous scientific evidence. Indeed, wearing a surgical mask for short periods of time does not impact significantly physiological respiratory variables[2] and thus, whenever a rise in CO2 occurs in the “dead space” of the mask, it is unlikely that the magnitude of this increase would be sufficient to impair immune, neurological, or cardiovascular homeostasis.

446,"US President Trump made vaccines voluntary, not mandatory, in the US.","What strategies did the evidence suggest to improve vaccination coverage rates, and how do these strategies relate to the claim that President Trump made vaccines voluntary, not mandatory, in the US?		
- In addition to state vaccination requirements, stronger health care practices such as more in-depth discussions with hesitant parents and establishing vaccination as the default are strategies to improve vaccination coverage rates (Opel and Omer; Yang and Silverman).		

What type of actions were vaccines under the policy implemented by US President Trump?		
vaccines were wholly discretionary actions and, as such, could not		

What is the current policy of the US government regarding vaccination requirements for daycare and school entry?		
State and local vaccination requirements for daycare and school entry are important tools for maintaining high vaccination coverage rates, and in turn, lower rates of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs).		

Does the availability of vaccines in the US depend on the supply, and if so, does this imply that vaccines are not mandatory?		
In addition, if the vaccine is available to the applicant but due to limited supply, it would cause significant delay for the applicant to receive the vaccination, then the civil surgeon should also annotate “not routinely available” on Form I-693.[11] USCIS may grant a blanket waiver in these cases.		

Does the evidence suggest that the US President has the authority to make vaccines mandatory or only voluntary?		
There is some evidence suggesting vaccination requirements that have broad reach, limited exemption criteria, and strong enforcement may help promote higher rates of vaccination coverage along with complementary actions such as monitoring VPD cases, vaccination coverage, and exemption rates; and also reporting on recent VPD outbreaks.		

Does the evidence suggest that President Trump made vaccines mandatory in the US?		
USCIS may grant a blanket waiver in the case of a vaccination shortage only if CDC recommends that USCIS should do so, and USCIS has published the appropriate guidance on its website.		

What is the relationship between the vaccination requirements and the rates of vaccination coverage and vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) according to the evidence?		
In summary, vaccination requirements that reach more children through a broad range of facilities, that have more requirements for receiving an exemption, that require parental documentation of exemption requests, and that are implemented with strong enforcement and monitoring may help promote higher rates of vaccination coverage, and in turn, lower rates of VPDs.

447,A virus can easily pass through a mask.,"Can a significant fraction of airborne viruses pass through the filters of some surgical masks?		
Some surgical masks may let a significant fraction of airborne viruses penetrate through their filters, providing very low protection against aerosolized infectious agents in the size range of 10 to 80 nm.		

Can a virus pass through a cloth mask, according to the available scientific evidence?		
Our review of relevant studies indicates that cloth masks will be ineffective at preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, whether worn as source control or as PPE.		

Can a cloth mask effectively filter out small particles, including viruses, from the air that is inhaled by the wearer?		
In sum, cloth masks exhibit very low filter efficiency. Thus, even masks that fit well against the face will not prevent inhalation of small particles by the wearer or emission of small particles from the wearer.		

Does the evidence suggest that cloth masks and face coverings are effective in preventing the transmission of COVID-19?		
In summary, though we support mask wearing by the general public, we continue to conclude that cloth masks and face coverings are likely to have limited impact on lowering COVID-19 transmission, because they have minimal ability to prevent the emission of small particles, offer limited personal protection with respect to small particle inhalation, and should not be recommended as a replacement for physical distancing or reducing time in enclosed spaces with many potentially infectious people.		

Does the evidence suggest that cloth masks or face coverings are effective in preventing the transmission of a virus?		
We do, however, have data from laboratory studies that indicate cloth masks or face coverings offer very low filter collection efficiency for the smaller inhalable particles we believe are largely responsible for transmission, particularly from pre- or asymptomatic individuals who are not coughing or sneezing.		

Can fabric masks effectively filter out respiratory droplets and reduce the transmission of COVID-19?		
The CDC failed to reference the National Academies of Sciences Rapid Expert Consultation on the Effectiveness of Fabric Masks for the COVID-19 Pandemic (NAS 2020), which concludes, “The evidence from…laboratory filtration studies suggests that such fabric masks may reduce the transmission of larger respiratory droplets.		

Can a surgical mask effectively prevent the transmission of a virus through respiratory droplets?		
While the data supporting the use of surgical masks as PPE in real-world settings are limited, the two meta-analyses and the most recent randomized controlled study51 combined with evidence of moderate filter efficiency and complete lack of facepiece fit lead us to conclude that surgical masks offer very low levels of protection for the wearer from aerosol inhalation.		

Does the 95% protection level of N95 respirators against airborne viruses imply that surgical masks, which have a lower protection level, can be easily bypassed by viruses?		
Do N95 respirators provide 95% protection level against airborne viruses, and how adequate are surgical masks?		

Can surgical masks effectively filter out small particles of a virus, thereby reducing the transmission of respiratory viral infections?		
The latter found surgical masks decreased emission of large particles (larger than 5 µm) by 25-fold and small particles by threefold from flu-infected patients.33 Sung37 found a 43% reduction in respiratory viral infections in stem-cell patients when everyone, including patients, visitors, and healthcare workers, wore surgical masks.		

How effective are N95 FFRs and surgical masks in limiting the spread of particles and viruses when worn by coughing individuals?		
There are few studies examining the effectiveness of respirators on patients. An N95 FFR on coughing human subjects showed greater effectiveness at limiting lateral particle dispersion than surgical masks (15 cm and 30 cm dispersion, respectively) in comparison to no mask (68 cm).

The President had previously announced a temporary halt of funding to the WHO and sent a letter to the agency earlier in May saying that the US would permanently pull funding if the WHO did not “commit to major substantive improvements in the next 30 days.”		

Did President Trump instruct his administration to halt funding of the World Health Organization while a review was conducted to assess the World Health Organization's role regarding the spread of coronavirus?		
In April 2020, Trump announced that he would freeze funding to the World Health Organization over his concerns that it is beholden to China’s interests, and in July, he said he would withdraw the United States from the body completely.		

Did President Trump instruct his administration to halt funding of the World Health Organization while a review was conducted to assess the World Health Organization's role regarding the spread of coronavirus?		
""I am directing my administration to halt funding while a review is conducted to assess the World Health Organization's role in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus,"" Mr Trump told a news conference at the White House on Tuesday.		

Why did President Trump decide to halt funding to the World Health Organization (WHO)?		
US President Donald Trump has said he is going to halt funding to the World Health Organization (WHO) because it has ""failed in its basic duty"" in its response to the coronavirus outbreak.		

Did the World Health Organization respond to President Trump's letter and warning about halting funding and reconsidering membership?		
The WHO had no immediate comment. Officials of the U.N. agency have not directly addressed a letter that Trump sent to the general director on May 18, warning he would make permanent a temporary freeze on U.S. funding and reconsider U.S. membership unless it committed to “major substantive improvements within the next 30 days.”		

What was the reason given by Trump for halting funding of the World Health Organization?		
The U.S. is the top contributor to the WHO; the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is second. Trump announced on Tuesday that he would order the U.S. to stop funding the WHO while his administration reviews the organization – which he accused of ""severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus.""

454,Face masks cause hypoxia.,"Does the evidence provided support the claim that face masks cause hypoxia?		
There is no proof that wearing a mask can reduce oxygen levels, also known as hypoxia. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S. CDC) recommend wearing cloth masks over a surgical mask in public, which are not too tight on our faces and allow for easy breathing.		

Does wearing a face mask cause a significant decrease in oxygen levels (hypoxia) in healthy individuals during physical activity?		
Although the body of literature directly evaluating this issue is evolving, for healthy individuals, the available data suggest that face masks, including N95 respirators, surgical masks, and cloth face masks, may increase dyspnea but have small and often difficult-to-detect effects on Wb, blood gases, and other physiological parameters during physical activity, even with heavy/maximal exercise.		

Does wearing a face mask during exercise at moderate intensity for 60 minutes lead to a decrease in arterial oxygen saturation below 97%?		
There are limited data reporting arterial blood gases during exercise while wearing a face mask. Arterial saturation remains above 97% while wearing a surgical mask or N95 respirator while exercising at moderate intensity for 60 minutes (29, 30), indicating that changes in PaO2 sufficient to affect ventilation are unlikely.		

Does wearing a face mask increase the risk of hypoxia due to reduced ventilation and rebreathing of exhaled carbon dioxide?		
Purported reasons for not wearing a face mask include concerns about increased dyspnea and work of breathing (Wb) as well as about alterations in pulmonary gas exchange associated with reduced ventilation and rebreathing of exhaled carbon dioxide (4).		

Do studies show that wearing face masks cause changes in physiological variables, such as oxygen levels, despite reports of increased dyspnea?		
The mechanisms of increased dyspnea with face masks are complicated by the fact that several studies fail to show changes in most physiological variables, despite increased dyspnea (15, 45).		

Does wearing a face mask during physical activity significantly impact exercise tolerance in individuals with severe cardiopulmonary disease, and if so, what are the potential effects on blood gases and dyspnea?		
Although the available data suggest that negative effects of using cloth or surgical face masks during physical activity in healthy individuals are negligible and unlikely to impact exercise tolerance significantly, for some individuals with severe cardiopulmonary disease, any added resistance and/or minor changes in blood gases may evoke considerably more dyspnea and, thus, affect exercise capacity.		

Does wearing a surgical mask during exercise cause a significant increase in carbon dioxide levels in the body, leading to hypoxia?		
Furthermore, when these patients performed a 6-minute walk test while wearing a surgical mask, PaCO2 increased by <1 mm Hg, indicating that significant alveolar hypoventilation and CO2 retention is unlikely to be induced by surgical masks during self-paced exercise.		

Does the evidence provided suggest that face masks cause hypoxia?		
Although more high-quality data from well-designed studies are needed, there is a substantial body of literature evaluating various effects on the cardiopulmonary system caused by the following types of face masks: low-resistance face coverings (i.e., cloth and surgical masks); N95 respirators; industrial respirators, such as self-contained breathing apparatuses (SCBAs); and applied external resistors, which generate high resistive loads or added dead space and are used in research studies.		

Does prolonged use of medical masks when properly worn lead to oxygen deficiency or hypoxia?		
The WHO says: ""The prolonged use of medical masks when properly worn, does not cause CO2 intoxication nor oxygen deficiency.		

Does wearing a face mask cause hypoxia, hypoxemia, or hypercapnia?

Since at least 2011, rumors have circulated claiming the Fox News television channel has been banned in Canada due to their running afoul of Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) prohibitions that make it ""illegal to broadcast lies and label it news"":		

Has the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) approved the transmission of Fox News in Canada?

Does the evidence suggest that Fox News is unavailable in Canada due to media legislation?		
(The claimed distinction that Fox News Channel is only allowed in Canada due to its being classified as an ""entertainment"" channel rather than as a ""news"" channel is a meaningless one, as those classifications only apply to Canadian media outlets, and Fox is an American company.)		

What was the concern of the CAB regarding the addition of Fox News to the digital lists?		
|The CAB had suggested that the addition of Fox News would create a precedent that would reward and encourage non-Canadian broadcasters to forgo partnerships with Canadian broadcasters in favour of gaining direct access to the Canadian market through inclusion on digital lists.

George Floyd had drugs in his system and severe heart disease when a Minneapolis police officer put a knee to his neck, but independent experts said the medical problems revealed in the full autopsy report don’t change the conclusion that the handcuffed man’s death was a homicide.		

What was the conclusion of the Hennepin County medical examiner's office regarding the cause and manner of George Floyd's death?		
While an autopsy by the Hennepin County medical examiner’s office did find drugs in Floyd’s system, it concluded that the cause of his death was “cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression,” and that the manner of death was “homicide.”		

What was the preliminary cause of death determined by the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office in the case of George Floyd?

That report, which was contained in the criminal complaint leveled against Chauvin last week, said the autopsy “revealed no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation,” and instead said Floyd died out of a combination of being restrained, potential intoxicants in his system and underlying health conditions like heart disease and hypertension.		

What were the contributing factors to George Floyd's death, according to the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office?		
According to the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office, Floyd's death was the result of being ""restrained by the police, his underlying health conditions and any potential intoxicants in his system.""

What does the evidence suggest about the cause of George Floyd's death, and how does it relate to the claim that he died of a drug overdose rather than US police brutality?		
Firstly, on May 29, 2020, court documents revealed the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's investigation into Floyd's death showed ""no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxiation,"" and that ""potential intoxicants"" and preexisting cardiovascular disease ""likely contributed to his death.""		

What were the contributing factors in George Floyd's death, according to the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's autopsy findings?		
Later on Monday, the Hennepin County Medical Examiner released details of its autopsy findings that also said Floyd’s death was a homicide caused by asphyxiation but that he had possible underlying health conditions and intoxicants in his body that may have been contributing factors in his death.

Did the White House consider political affiliation of governors when developing its response to the coronavirus pandemic?		
Recent reports indicate that a comprehensive national testing plan developed by the White House was shelved after White House officials, including those close to President's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, concluded that the pandemic was primarily affecting Democratic states, and therefore could be blamed on Democratic governors.

488,Mobs torched our cities while popular members of Congress promote the same socialism my father fought against in World War II.,"What is the historical context of the conflict between socialism and democracy in the United States, according to the evidence provided?		
Socialism, since its creation has been at war with democracy in the US. Monetary control from within the US and outside has been the cause of many wars.		

Did the mobs that torched cities in the claim refer to the same socialism that the speaker's father fought against in World War II?		
When the American government openly violates American laws, left and right, that is further grounds to support the theory of an impending civil war that will be fought by a diversity of factions, some more or less conservative, liberal, moderate, eccentric and all in between, because out of all people and agencies, government is meant to abide by its own laws, and when government consistently violates its own laws and/or writes new laws that are unconstitutional by its own operation, it furthermore weakens its credibility, the sympathy it receives from its citizens, and the result is the opening of the window for an all out civil war, not so much fought by “Patriots VS Progressives” but more specifically, “The People VS the Government.”		

Is the speaker accusing popular members of Congress of promoting socialism that is similar to the kind their father fought against in World War II?		
I am not using fascism as a political slur, instead, I am stating it from the position that the outgroup your information base points to is the poor and immigrant populations, despite preaching anti-elitist(anti-wealthy) sentiment.		

Who is being accused of promoting socialism that the speaker's father fought against in World War II?

How does the evidence relate to the claim that popular members of Congress promote the same socialism that the speaker's father fought against in World War II?		
The tradition of social insurance would come to be seen as the reasonable, practical alternative to the radical calls to action represented by Townsend, Long, Sinclair and the others.		

Did the speaker's father fight against socialism during World War II?		
But as a former Democrat, I can tell you Norman Thomas isn't the only man who has drawn this parallel to socialism with the present administration, because back in 1936, Mr. Democrat himself, Al Smith, the great American, came before the American people and charged that the leadership of his Party was taking the Party of Jefferson, Jackson, and Cleveland down the road under the banners of Marx, Lenin, and Stalin.		

What historical event or ideology is being compared by the speaker between the Democratic Party and the World War II era?

How does Joe Biden's climate plan, which aims to achieve net-zero U.S. GHG emissions by 2050, differ from President Trump's energy independence policy?

Parts of the Biden agenda involve reinstating and, in some cases, strengthening regulations that the Trump administration is working to remove, including limiting methane emissions, strengthening fuel economy standards, and prohibiting fossil fuel development on public lands.		

Does Joe Biden plan to abolish fossil fuels and end fracking, which would reverse the energy independence achieved by President Donald Trump?		
But Biden is also tethered to Obama’s “all-of-the-above” philosophy, which left ample room for the fracking boom that bolstered one fossil fuel, natural gas, over another, coal, and put the U.S. on track to become the world’s leading oil producer.

498,"As we speak the US are developing a growing number of treatments, including convalescent plasma, that are saving lives all across the country.","Has the evidence provided by Dr. Thomas File, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, supported the claim that convalescent plasma is saving lives across the country?		
“While the data to date show some positive signals that convalescent plasma can be helpful in treating individuals with COVID-19, especially if given early in the trajectory of disease, we lack the randomized controlled trial data we need to better understand its utility in COVID-19 treatment,” Dr. Thomas File, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said in a statement.		

Has the evidence provided sufficient support for the claim that convalescent plasma is saving lives across the country?		
This has led to calls for the wider adoption of convalescent plasma for COVID-19 (23). Nonetheless, while the data support safety and potential efficacy of convalescent plasma, randomized trials are needed (23).		

Does the evidence suggest that convalescent plasma is definitively effective in saving lives across the country, or are the studies still inconclusive?		
Studies have shown that convalescent plasma for COVID-19 is generally safe. And while other studies have hinted that the treatment shows promise, they aren't definitive answers about whether it's effective.		

Has the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved convalescent plasma as a treatment for COVID-19?		
""Although promising, convalescent plasma has not yet been shown to be safe and effective as a treatment for COVID-19,"" the agency wrote.		

Are the treatments, including convalescent plasma, being developed in the US actually saving lives across the country?		
“Although promising, convalescent plasma has not been shown to be effective in every disease studied” and therefore clinical trials were needed to see if it was useful in covid-19, the FDA cautioned.		

Has the use of convalescent plasma been successful in treating diseases other than COVID-19?		
While the use of convalescent plasma for COVID-19 was only recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for clinical trials and expanded clinical use, it has been successful in the past for treating diseases such as hepatitis B, influenza and Ebola.		

Are the treatments, including convalescent plasma, being developed in the US actually saving lives across the country, or is the claim based on incomplete or unproven data?		
Data from rigorously controlled clinical trials of convalescent plasma are also few, underscoring the need to evaluate its use objectively for a range of indications (e.g., prevention vs. treatment) and patient populations (e.g., age, comorbid disease).		

Are there any randomized clinical trials being conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of convalescent plasma in treating COVID-19?		
However, like blood, convalescent plasma is in limited supply and must come from donors. And while there are promising signals from some studies, there is not yet randomized clinical trial data on convalescent plasma to treat Covid-19.		

Has the US government reported any clinical benefit from using convalescent plasma in treating COVID-19 patients?		
Convalescent plasma has also been used in the COVID-19 pandemic; limited data from China suggest clinical benefit, including radiological resolution, reduction in viral loads, and improved survival.		

Is there evidence that convalescent plasma has been used to treat patients with COVID-19 in the US?
